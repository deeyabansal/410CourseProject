## Description
Our project is designed to help students while working on the programming assignments in CS 410. Students can use this project to find which lectures in the course have information that correlates to a certain MP.

## How it works
After running the program, give an MP(eg. MP1, MP2.2) as the input. For MP 1, MP 3, and MP 4, the input should just be given as an integer (1, 3 or 4). For MP 2.1 - 2.4, the input should be given as 2_1, 2_2, 2_3, or 2_4. The program will give an ranked list of relevant lecutres in the course.

#### Algorithms
BM25 Ranking function
Removing stop words from lecture data
Creating bounds for relevant lectures for MPs
