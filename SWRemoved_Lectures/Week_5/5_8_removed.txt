 talked PageRank way capture assault
 looked examples hub might interesting
 another algorithm called HITS compute scores authorities hubs
 intuitions pages widely cited good authorities whereas pages cite many pages good hubs
 think interesting idea algorithm HITS use reinforcement mechanism kind help improve scoring hubs authorities
 idea assumed good authorities cited good hubs
 That means cited many pages good hub scores inquiry says authority
 similarly good hubs point good authorities
 pointed lot good authority pages hubs score increased
 literally reinforced pointed good hubs
 pointed good authorities get good hubs score whereas authority scores improved pointing good hub
 algorithms general many applications graph network analysis
 briefly works
 first construct matrix time construct adjacent matrix normalize values
 link 1 link 0
 Again graph
 define hubs score page sum authority scores pages appoints
 whether hub really depends whether pointing lot good authority pages
 That says first equation
 second equation define authorities page sum hub scores pages appoint
 whether good authority depend whether pages pointing good hubs
 forms iterative reinforcement mechanism
 three questions written metrics format
 get hub vector equal product adjacency matrix authority vector basically first equation
 similarly second equation returned authority vector equal product transpose multiplied hub vector
 different ways expressing equations
 interesting look matrix form plug authority equation first one
 actually eliminated authority vector completely get equations hubs scores
 hubs score vector equal multiplied transpose multiplied hub score
 Similarly transformation equation authorities
 although frame problem computing hubs authorities actually eliminate one obtain equation one
 difference page random matrix actually multiplication adjacency matrix transpose
 different page rank
 mathematically computing problem
 HITS typically initialize values
 Let say 1 values iteratively apply equations essentially
 equivalent multiply metrics transpose
 arrows exactly PageRank
 adjacency matrix normalized
 iteration normalize allow control growth value
 Otherwise grow larger larger
 basically get HITS
 That computer hubs scores authority scores pages
 scores used branching PageRank scores
 summarize seen link information useful
 particular anchor text useful increase text representation page
 talk PageRank page anchor two major link analysis algorithms
 Both generate scores web pages used ranking function
 Note PageRank HITS general algorithms
 many applications analyzing graphs networks
