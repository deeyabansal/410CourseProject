 discussion text retrieval methods
 particular talk feedback text retrieval
 diagram shows retrieval process
 user type query
 query sent retrieval engine search engine engine return results
 results issued user
 user seen results user actually make judgements
 example user says well good document useful good etc
 called relevance judgment relevance feedback got feedback information user based judgements
 useful system knowing exactly interesting user
 feedback module take input use document collection try improve ranking
 Typically involve updating query system render results accurately user
 called relevance feedback
 feedback based relevance judgements made users
 judgements reliable users generally want make extra effort unless
 side involves extra effort user
 There another form feedback called pseudo relevance feedback blind feedback called automatic feedback
 case user gotten [ INAUDIBLE ] fact invoke users
 user involved
 simply assume top rank documents relevant
 Let say assumed top 10 relevant
 use assume documents learn improve query
 might wonder could help simply assume top rank documents Well imagine top rank documents actually similar relevant documents even relevant
 They look relevant documents
 possible learn related terms query set
 fact may recall talked using language model analyze association learn related words word computer
 first use computer retrieve documents contain computer
 imagine query computer
 result documents contain computer
 take top n results
 They match computer well
 count terms set
 use background language model choose terms frequent set frequent whole collection
 make contrast two find related terms word computer
 As seen
 related words added original query expand query
 help bring documents necessarily match computer match words program software
 effective improving search result
 course pseudo-relevancy values completely unreliable
 arbitrarily set cut
 something called implicit feedback
 case involve users ask users make judgments
 Instead observe user interacts search results
 case look clickthroughs
 user clicked one
 user viewed one
 user skipped one
 user viewed one
 clue whether document useful user
 even assume use snippet document text actually seen user instead actual document entry
 link saying web search may broken matter
 user tries fetch document displayed text assume displayed text probably relevant interesting learn information
 called interesting feedback
 use information update query
 important technique used modern
 think Google Bing collect lot user activities serving
 observe documents click documents skip
 information valuable
 use improve search engine
 summarize talked three kinds feedback
 Relevant feedback user makes explicit judgements
 takes user effort judgment information reliable
 talk pseudo feedback seem assume top brand marking relevant
 involve user therefore could actually return results user
 third implicit feedback use clickthroughs
 Where involve users user make explicitly fault
 Make judgement
