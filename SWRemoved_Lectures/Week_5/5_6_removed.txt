 link analysis web search
 talk web search particularly focusing link analysis use results improve search
 main topic look ranking algorithms Web Search
 previous talked create index
 index want improve ranking Pages
 web
 standard IR models applied
 fact important building blocks improve supporting web search
 sufficient
 mainly following reasons
 First web tend different information needs example people might search webpage entry page
 different traditional library search people primarily interested collecting literature Information
 kind query often called navigational queries
 purpose navigate particular type page
 queries might benefit using link information
 Secondly documents additional information web pages web format lot clues layout title link information
 provided opportunity use extra context information document improve scoring
 finally information quality varies lot
 That means consider many factors improve range algorithm
 give robust way rank pages making harder spammer manipulate one signal improve ranking page
 result people made number major extensions ranking algorithms
 One line exploit links improve scoring
 main topic
 People proposed algorithms exploit loudest implicit
 Feedback information form click throughs course category feedback techniques machine often used
 general web search ranking algorithms based machine learning algorithms combine kinds features
 Many based standard virtual models BM25 talked [ INAUDIBLE ] score different parts documents provide additional features based content matching link information useful provide additional scoring signals
 let look links detail web
 snapshot part web let say
 many links link different pages together
 case look center description link pointing document right side
 description text called anchor text
 think text actually quite useful provides extra description page points
 example someone wants bookmark
 front page person might say biggest online bookstore link Amazon right description similar user type query box looking page
 useful managing pages
 Suppose someone types query online bookstore biggest online bookstore
 All right query match anchor text page
 actually provides evidence matching page pointed Amazon
 entry page
 match anchor text describes anchor page actually provides good evidence elements page pointed
 anchor text useful
 look bottom part picture patterns links links might indicate utility document
 example right side page received many inlinks
 means many pages pointing page
 shows page quite useful
 On left side another page points many pages
 director page allow actually lot pages
 call first case authority page second case half page means link information help intuit
 One provide extra text matching
 provide additional scores webpage characterize likely page hub likely page authority
 people course proposed ideas leverage link information
 Google PageRank main technique used early days good example algorithm capture page popularity basically score authority
 intuitions links citations literature
 think one page pointing another page similar one paper citing another paper
 course page cited often assume page useful general
 good intuition
 PageRank essentially take advantage Intuition implement principal approach
 Intuitively essentially citation counting link counting
 improves simple idea two ways
 One consider indirect citations
 means look many links
 look pages pointing
 pages lot in-links means lot
 sense get credit
 pages pointing pointed pages many in-links well get much
 idea getting indirect citation
 All right understand idea looking research papers
 cited let say ten papers ten papers workshop papers papers influential right although got ten in-links good cited ten papers attracted lot citations
 case consider indirect links page
 idea good pseudo citations
 Assume basically every page number zero pseudo citation count
 Essentially trying imagine many virtual links link pages together actually get pseudo citations everyone
 reason want
 Is allow solve problem elegantly linear algebra technique
 think maybe best way understand PageRank think computer probability random surfer visiting every webpage
