 previous talked natural language content analysis
 explained state natural language processing techniques still good enough process lot unrestricted text data robust manner
 As result bag words remains popular applications search engine
 talk high-level strategies help users get access text data
 important step convert raw big text data small random data
 That actually needed specific application
 main question address text information system help users get access relevant text data cover two complimentary strategies push versus pull
 talk two ways implement pull mode querying versus browsing
 first push versus pull
 two different ways connect users right information right time
 difference takes initiative party takes initiative
 pull mode users take initiative start information access process
 case user typically use search engine fulfill goal
 For example user may type query browse results find relevant information
 usually appropriate satisfying user ad hoc information need
 An ad hoc information need temporary information need
 For example want buy product suddenly need read reviews related product
 cracked information purchased product
 generally longer need information temporary information need
 case hard system predict need proper users take initiative search engines useful
 Today many people many information needs time
 speaking Google probably processing many queries
 mostly adequate
 Information needs
 pull mode
 contrast push mode system take initiative push information user recommend information user
 case usually supported recommender system
 appropriate
 user stable information
 For example may research interest topic interest tends stay
 rather stable
 Your hobby another example
 stable information need case system interact learn interest monitor information stream
 system seen relevant items interest system could take initiative recommend information
 example news filter news recommended system could monitor news stream identify interesting news simply push news articles
 mode information access may property system good knowledge users need happens search context
 example search information web search engine might infer might interested something related
 Formation
 recommend information reminds example advertisement placed search page
 two high level strategies two modes text access
 let look pull mode detail
 pull mode distinguish two ways help users
 Querying versus browsing
 querying user enter query
 Typical keyword query search engine system return relevant documents use
 works well user knows exactly keywords used
 know exactly looking tend know right keywords
 query works well time
 know sometimes work well
 When know right keywords use query want browse information topic area
 use browsing useful
 case case browsing users simply navigate relevant information following paths supported structures documents
 system maintain kind structures user could follow structures navigate
 really works well user wants explore information space user know keywords using query
 Or simply user finds inconvenient type query
 even user knows query type user using cellphone search information
 still harder enter query
 case browsing tends convenient
 relationship browsing querying best understood making imagine site seeing
 Imagine touring city
 know exact address attraction
 Taking taxi perhaps fastest way
 go directly site
 know exact address may need walk around
 Or take taxi nearby place walk around
 turns exactly information studies
 know exactly looking use right keywords query find information
 That usually fastest way find information
 know exact keywords use Well clearly probably wo well
 related pages
 need walk around information space meaning following links browsing
 finally get relevant page
 want learn
 likely lot browsing looking around area want interesting attractions related
 [ INAUDIBLE ]
 analogy tells good support query really good support browsing
 order browse effectively need map guide need map
 Of Chicago city Chicago need topical map tour information space
 construct topical map fact interesting research question might bring interesting browsing experience web applications
 summarize talked two high level strategies text access ; push pull
 Push tends supported Recommender System Pull tends supported Search Engine
 Of course sophisticated [ INAUDIBLE ] information system combine two
 pull mode [ INAUDIBLE ] Querying Browsing
 Again generally want combine two ways help assist support querying nad browsing
 want know relationship pull push read article
 give excellent discussion relationship machine filtering information retrieval
 Here informational filtering similar information recommendation push mode information access
