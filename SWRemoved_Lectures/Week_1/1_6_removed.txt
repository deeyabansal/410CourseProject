 discussion vector space model one particular approach design ranking function
 talk use general framework vector space model guidance instantiate framework derive specific ranking function
 cover symbolist instantiation framework
 discussed previous vector space model really framework
 say
 As discussed previous vector space model really framework
 say many things
 example shows say define dimension
 say place document vector space
 say place query vector vector space
 finally say measure similarity query vector document vector
 imagine order implement model say specifically compute vectors
 What exactly xi exactly yi determine place document vector place query vector
 course need say exactly similarity function
 provide definition concepts define dimensions xi yi namely weights terms queries document able place document vectors query vectors well defined space
 specify similarity function well defined ranking function
 let think instantiation
 Actually suggest pause point spend couple minutes think
 Suppose asked implement idea
 come idea vector space model still figured compute vectors exactly define similarity function
 What think couple minutes proceed
 let think simplest ways instantiating vector space model
 First define dimension Well obvious choice use word vocabulary define dimension
 show N words vocabulary
 Therefore N dimensions
 Each word defines one dimension
 basically bag words let look place vectors space
 Again simplest strategy use Bit Vector represent query document
 means element xi yi taking value either zero 1
 When 1 means corresponding word present document query
 When 0 mean absent
 imagine user types words query query vector 1 many many zeros
 document vector generally 1 course
 many zeros since vocabulary generally large
 Many words really occur document
 Many words occasionally occur document
 lot words absent particular document
 placed documents query vector space
 Let look measure similarity
 commonly used similarity measure Dot Product
 Dot Product two vectors simply defined sum products corresponding elements two vectors
 product x1 y1

 x2 multiplied y2
 finally xn multiplied yn
 take sum
 Dot Product
 represent general way using sum
 one many different ways measuring similarity
 defined dimensions defined vectors defined similarity function
 finally simplest vector space model based bit vector [ INAUDIBLE ] dot product similarity bag words [ INAUDIBLE ]
 formula looks
 formula
 actually particular retrieval function ranking function right finally implement function using program language rank documents query
 point pause think interpreted score
 gone process modeling retrieval problem using vector space model
 make assumptions place vectors vector space define similarity
 end got specific retrieval function shown
 next step think whether retrieval function actually makes sense right Can expect function actually perform well used rank documents user queries worth thinking value calculating
 end get number
 number mean Is meaningful spend couple minutes sort think
 course general question believe good ranking function Would actually work well think interpret value
 Is actually meaningful Does mean something related well document matched query
 order assess whether simplest vector space model actually works well let look example
 show sample documents sample query
 query news presidential campaign
 five documents
 They cover different terms query
 look documents moment may realize documents probably relevant others probably relevant
 asked rank documents rank basically ideal ranking
 When humans examine documents try rank
 think moment take look slide
 perhaps pausing
 think agree d4 d3 probably better others really cover query well
 They match news presidential campaign
 looks documents probably better others
 They ranked top
 three d2 d1 d5 really relevant
 say d4 d3 relevant documents d1 d2 d5 non-relevant
 let simplest vector space model could could something closer
 let first think actually use model score documents
 All right
 Here show two documents d1 d3
 query
 vector space model course want first compute vectors documents query
 showed vocabulary well
 end dimensions thinking
 think vector query Note assuming use zero 1 indicate whether term absent present query document
 zero,1 bit vectors
 think query vector Well query four words
 four words 1
 rest zeros
 documents
 d1 two rows news
 two 1 rest zeroes
 Similarly two vectors let compute similarity
 use Do Product
 use Dot Product multiply corresponding elements right two formal product two generate another product two generate yet another product forth
 easily actually care zeroes whenever zero product zero
 take sum pairs zero entries gone
 As long one zero product zero
 fact counting many pairs 1 1
 case seen two result 2
 mean Well means number value scoring function simply count many unique query terms matched document
 Because term matched document two one
 zero document side
 Similarly document term term query zero query vector
 count
 result scoring function basically measures many unique query terms matched document
 interpret score
 take look d3
 case result 3 d3 matched three distinctive query words news presidential campaign whereas d1 matched two
 case seems reasonable rank d3 top d1
 simplest vector space model indeed
 looks pretty good
 However examine model detail likely find problems
 'm show scores five documents
 easily verify correct basically counting number unique query terms matched document
 note measure actually makes sense right basically means document matches unique query terms document assumed relevant
 seems make sense
 problem note three documents d2 d3 d4
 tied 3 score
 problem look carefully seems d4 ranked d3 d3 mentions presidential d4 mentioned multiple times
 case d3 presidential could dimension
 d4 clearly presidential campaign
 Another problem d2 d3 score
 look three words matched case d2 matched news campaign
 case d3 matched news presidential campaign
 intuitively reads better matching presidential important matching even though presidential query
 intuitively d3 ranked d2
 model
 means model still good enough
 solve problems
 To summarize talked instantiate vector space model
 mainly need three things
 One define dimension
 second decide place documents vectors vector space place query vector space vector
 third define similarity two vectors particularly query vector document vector
 talked various simple way instantiate vector space model
 Indeed probably simplest vector space model derive
 case use word define dimension
 use zero 1 bit vector represent document query
 case basically care word presence absence
 ignore frequency
 use Dot Product similarity function
 instantiation showed scoring function basically score document based number distinct query words matched document
 showed simple vector space model still work well need improve
