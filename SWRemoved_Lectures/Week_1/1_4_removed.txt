 overview text retrieval methods
 previous introduced problem text retrieval
 explained main problem design ranking function rank documents query
 give overview different ways designing ranking function
 problem following
 query sequence words document sequence words
 hope define function f compute score based query document
 main challenge hear design good ranking function rank relevant documents top non-relevant ones
 Clearly means function must able measure likelihood document relevant query q
 That means way define relevance
 particular order implement program computational definition relevance
 achieve goal designing retrieval model gives formalization relevance
 many decades researchers designed many different kinds retrieval models
 fall different categories
 First one family models based similarity idea
 Basically assume document similar query another document say first document relevant second one
 case ranking function defined similarity query document
 One well known example case vector space model cover detail later
 second kind models called probabilistic models
 family models follow different strategy assume queries documents observations random variables
 assume binary random variable called R indicate whether document relevant query
 define score document respect query probability random variable R equal 1 given particular document query
 There different cases general idea
 One classic probabilistic model another language model yet another divergence randomness model
 later talk one case language model
 third kind model based probabilistic inference
 idea associate uncertainty inference rules quantify probability show query follows document
 Finally family models using axiomatic thinking
 Here idea define set constraints hope good retrieval function satisfy
 case problem seek good ranking function satisfy desired constraints
 Interestingly although different models based different thinking end retrieval function tends similar
 functions tend involve similar variables
 let take look common form state art retrieval model examine common ideas used models
 First models based assumption using bag words represent text explained natural language processing
 Bag words representation remains main representation used search engines
 assumption score query presidential campaign news respect document based scores computed based individual word
 means score depend score word presidential campaign news
 Here three different components corresponding well document matches query words
 Inside functions number heuristics used
 example one factor affects function many times word presidential occur document called term frequency TF
 might denote c presidential
 general word occurs frequently document value function larger
 Another factor long document use document length scoring
 general term occurs long document many times significant occurred number times short document
 Because long document term expected occur frequently
 Finally factor called document frequency
 That want look often presidential occurs entire collection call document frequency df presidential
 models might use probability characterize information
 show probability presidential collection
 trying characterize popularity term collection
 general matching rare term collection contributing overall score matching common term
 captures main ideas used pretty much older state art original models
 natural question model works best turns many models work equally well
 list four major models generally regarded state art original models pivoted length normalization BM25 query likelihood PL2
 When optimized models tend perform similarly
 discussed detail reference end
 Among BM25 probably popular
 likely used virtually search engines often method discussed research papers
 talk method later lectures
 summarize main points made first design good ranking function pre-requires computational definition relevance achieve goal designing appropriate retrieval model
 Second many models equally effective single winner yet
 Researchers still active working problem trying find truly optimal retrieval model
 Finally state art ranking functions tend rely following ideas
 First bag words representation
 Second TF document frequency words
 Such information used weighting function determine overall contribution matching word document length
 often combined interesting ways discuss exactly combined rank documents lectures later
 There two suggested additional readings time
 first paper find detailed discussion comparison multiple state art models
 second book chapter gives broad review different retrieval models
