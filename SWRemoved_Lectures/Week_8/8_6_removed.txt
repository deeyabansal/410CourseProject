 topic mining analysis
 talk using term topic
 slide seen earlier define task topic mining analysis
 raised question exactly define topic theta offer one way define initial idea
 Our idea defining topic simply term
 term word phrase
 general use terms describe topics
 first thought define topic one term
 For example might terms sports travel science
 define topic way analyze coverage topics document
 Here example might want discover extent document one covers sports
 found 30 % content document one sports
 12 % travel etc
 might discover document two cover sports
 coverage zero etc
 course discussed task definition topic mining analysis two tasks
 One discover topics
 second analyze coverage
 let first think discover topics represent topic term
 means need mine k topical terms collection
 course many different ways
 talk natural way likely effective
 first parse text data collection obtain candidate terms
 Here candidate terms words phrases
 Let say simplest solution take word term
 words become candidate topics
 Then design scoring function match good term topic
 design function Well many things consider
 For example use pure statistics design scoring function
 Intuitively favor representative terms meaning terms represent lot content collection
 mean want favor frequent term
 However simply use frequency design scoring function highest scored terms general terms functional terms etc
 Those terms occur frequently English
 want avoid words top want penalize words
 general favor terms fairly frequent frequent
 particular approach could based TF-IDF weighting retrieval
 TF stands term frequency
 IDF stands inverse document frequency
 talked ideas lectures discovery word associations
 statistical methods meaning function defined mostly based statistics
 scoring function general
 applied language text
 apply approach particular problem might able leverage domain-specific heuristics
 For example news might favor title words actually general
 might want favor title words authors tend use title describe topic article
 dealing tweets could favor hashtags invented denote topics
 naturally hashtags good candidates representing topics
 Anyway design scoring function discover k topical terms simply picking k terms highest scores
 course might encounter situation highest scored terms similar
 They semantically similar closely related even synonyms
 desirable
 want coverage content collection
 remove redundancy
 one way greedy algorithm sometimes called maximal marginal relevance ranking
 Basically idea go list based scoring function gradually take terms collect k topical terms
 first term course picked
 When pick next term look terms already picked try avoid picking term similar
 considering ranking term list considering redundancy candidate term respect terms already picked
 thresholding get balance redundancy removal high score term
 Okay get k topical terms
 regarded topics discovered connection
 Next let think compute topic coverage pi sub ij
 looking picture sports travel science topics
 suppose give document
 How pick coverage topic document Well one approach simply count occurrences terms
 example sports might occurred four times document travel occurred twice etc
 normalize counts estimate coverage probability topic
 general formula collect counts terms represent topics
 simply normalize coverage topic document add one
 forms distribution topics document characterize coverage different topics document
 always think idea solving problem ask question good one Or best way solving problem let examine approach
 general empirical evaluation using actual data sets well works
 Well case let take look simple example
 text document NBA basketball game
 terms content sports
 simply count words represent topics find word sports actually occur article even though content sports
 count sports zero
 That means coverage sports estimated zero
 course term science occur document estimate zero
 okay
 sports certainly okay know content sports
 estimate problem
 What worse term travel actually occurred document
 estimate coverage topic travel got non-zero count
 estimated coverage non-zero
 obviously desirable
 simple example illustrates problems approach
 First count words belong topic need consider related words
 ca simply count topic word sports
 case occur
 many related words basketball game etc
 need count related words
 second problem word star actually ambiguous
 probably means basketball star imagine might mean star sky
 case star might actually suggest perhaps topic science
 need deal well
 Finally main restriction approach one term describe topic really describe complicated topics
 For example specialized topic sports harder describe using word one phrase
 need use words
 example illustrates general problems approach treating term topic
 First lacks expressive power
 Meaning represent simple general topics represent complicated topics might require words describe
 Second incomplete vocabulary coverage meaning topic represented one term
 suggest terms related topic
 Even talking sports many terms related
 allow easily count related terms order conversion coverage topic
 Finally problem word sense disintegration
 topical term related term ambiguous
 For example basketball star versus star sky
 next talk solve problem topic
