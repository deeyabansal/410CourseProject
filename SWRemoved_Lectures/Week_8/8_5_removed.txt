 topic mining analysis
 talk motivation task definition
 talk different kind mining task
 As road map covered mining knowledge language namely discovery word associations paradigmatic relations syntagmatic relations
 starting talk mining another kind knowledge content mining trying discover knowledge main topics text
 call topic mining analysis
 talk motivation task definition
 first let look concept topic
 topic something understand think actually easy formally define
 Roughly speaking topic main idea discussed text data
 think theme subject discussion conversation
 different granularities
 For example talk topic sentence
 topic article aa topic paragraph topic research articles research library right different grand narratives topics obviously different applications
 Indeed many applications require discovery topics text analyzed
 Here examples
 For example might interested knowing Twitter users talking Are talking NBA sports talking international events
 Or interested knowing research topics
 For example one might interested knowing current research topics data mining different five years ago involves discovery topics data mining literatures want discover topics literature past
 make comparison
 might interested knowing people products iPhone 6 dislike involves discovering topics positive opinions iPhone 6 negative reviews
 Or perhaps interested knowing major topics debated 2012 presidential election discovering topics text analyzing talk lot techniques
 general view topic knowledge world
 text data expect discover number topics topics generally provide description world
 tells something world
 About product person etc
 non-text data context analyzing topics
 For example might know time associated text data locations text data produced authors text sources text etc
 All meta data context variables associated topics discover use context variables help analyze patterns topics
 For example looking topics time able discover whether trending topic topics might fading away
 Soon looking topics different locations
 might know insights people opinions different locations
 mining topics important
 let look tasks topic mining analysis
 general involve first discovering lot topics case k topics
 know topics covered documents extent
 example document one might Topic 1 covered lot Topic 2 Topic k covered small portion
 topics perhaps covered
 Document two hand covered Topic 2 well cover Topic 1 covers Topic k extent
 right generally two different tasks sub-tasks first discover k topics collection text laid
 What k topics Okay major topics text
 second task figure documents cover topics extent
 formally define problem follows
 First input collection N text documents
 Here denote text collection C denote text article
 generally need input number topics
 may techniques automatically suggest number topics
 techniques discuss useful techniques often need specify number topics
 output k topics discover order theta sub one theta sub
 want generate coverage topics document sub denoted pi sub j
 pi sub ij probability document sub covering topic theta sub j
 obviously document set values indicate extent document covers topic
 assume probabilities sum one
 Because document wo able cover topics outside topics discussed discovered
 question define theta sub define topic problem completely defined define exactly theta
 next lectures talk different ways define theta
