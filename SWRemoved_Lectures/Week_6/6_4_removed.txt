 future web search
 talk possible future trends web search intelligent information retrieval systems general
 order improve accuracy search engine important consider special cases information need
 one particular trend could specialized customized search engines called vertical search engines
 vertical search engines expected effective current general search engines could assume users special group users might common information need search engine customized ser users
 customization possible personalization
 search personalized better understanding users
 Because restrictions domain advantages handling documents better understanding documents
 For example particular words may ambiguous domain
 bypass problem ambiguity
 Another trend expect search engine able learn time
 lifetime learning lifelong learning course attractive means search engine self-improve
 As people using search engine become better better already happening search engines learn [ INAUDIBLE ] feedback
 More users use quality search engine allows popular queries typed many users allow become better sort another feature
 third trend might integration bottles information access
 search navigation recommendation filtering might combined form full-fledged information management system
 beginning course talked push versus pull
 different modes information access modes combined
 similarly pull mode querying browsing could combined
 fact basically [ INAUDIBLE ] search endings
 querying sometimes browsing clicking links
 Sometimes got information recommended
 Although cases information recommended advertising
 future imagine seamlessly integrate system multi-mode information access convenient people
 Another trend might systems try go beyond searches support user tasks
 After reason people want search solve problem make decision perform task
 For example consumers might search opinions products order purchase product choose good product case beneficial support whole workflow purchasing product choosing product
 era common search engines already provide good support
 For example sometimes look reviews want buy click button go shopping site directly get done
 provide good task support many tasks
 For example researchers might want find realm literature site literature
 much support finishing task writing paper
 general think many opportunities wait
 following slides talking little bit specific ideas thoughts hopefully help imagining new application possibilities
 Some might already relevant currently working
 general think intelligent system especially intelligent information system specified three nodes
 connect three triangle able specify information system
 call Data-User-Service Triangle
 basically three questions ask serving kind data managing kind service provide
 Right help basically specify system
 many different ways connect depending connect different kind systems
 let give examples
 On top different kinds users
 On left side different types data information bottom different service functions
 imagine connect different ways
 example connect everyone web pages support search browsing get Well web search right What connect UIUC employees organization documents enterprise documents support search browsing enterprise search
 connect scientist literature information provide kinds service including search browsing alert new random documents mining analyzing research trends provide task support decision support
 For example might might able provide support automatically generating related work section research paper closer task support
 Right imagine literature assistant
 connect online shoppers blog articles product reviews help people improve shopping experience
 provide example data mining capabilities analyze reviews compare products compare sentiment products provide task support decision support choose product buy
 Or connect customer service people emails customers imagine system provide analysis emails find major complaints customers
 imagine system could provide task support automatically generating response customer email
 Maybe intelligently attach promotion message appropriate detect positive message complaint might take opportunity attach promotion information
 Whereas complaint might able automatically generate generic response first tell customer expect detailed response later etc
 All trying help people improve productivity
 shows opportunities really lot
 restricted imagination
 picture shows trend technology characterizes intelligent information system three angles
 center triangle connects keyword queries search bag words representation
 That means current search engines basically provides search support users mostly model users based keyword queries sees data bag words representation
 simple approximation actual information documents
 current system
 connects three nodes simple way provides basic search function really understand user really understand much information documents
 showed trends push node toward advanced function
 think user node right go beyond keyword queries look user search history model user completely understand user task environment task need context information
 Okay pushing personalization complete user model
 major direction research order build intelligent information systems
 On document side go beyond bag words implementation entity relation representation
 means recognize people names relations locations etc
 already feasible natural processing technique
 Google reason initiative knowledge graph
 heard good step toward direction
 get level without initiating robust manner larger scale enable search engine provide much better service
 future knowledge representation add perhaps inference rules search engine become intelligent
 calls large-scale semantic analysis perhaps feasible vertical search engines
 easier make progress particular domain
 service side need go beyond search support information access general
 search one way get access information well recommender systems push pull different ways get access random information
 beyond access need help people digest information information found step analysis information data mining
 find patterns convert text information real knowledge used application actionable knowledge used decision making
 furthermore knowledge used help user improve productivity finishing task example decision-making task
 Right trend
 basically dimension anticipate future intelligent information systems provide intelligent interactive task support
 emphasize interactive important optimize combined intelligence users system
 get help users natural way
 assume system everything human user machine collaborate intelligent way efficient way combined intelligence high general minimize user overall effort solving problem
 big picture future intelligent information systems hopefully provide insights make innovations top handled
