 let take look specific method based regression
 one many different methods fact one simplest methods
 choose explain idea simple
 approach simply assume relevance document respect query related linear combination features
 Here used Xi denote feature
 Xi Q D feature
 many features
 assume features combined linear manner
 feature controlled parameter beta parameter
 That weighting parameter
 larger value mean feature higher weight contribute scoring function
 specific form function actually involves transformation probability relevance
 probability relevance
 know probability relevance within range 0 1
 could assumed scoring function related linear combination
 linear regression
 value linear combination could easily go beyond 1
 transformation map 0 1 range whole range real values verify
 allows connect probability variance 0 1 linear combination arbitrary features
 rewrite probability function get next one
 equation probability relevance
 right hand side form
 form clearly nonnegative still involves linear combination features
 clear value actually negative linear combination equation
 value large mean value small
 therefore whole probability large
 expect basically mean combination gives high value document likely irrelevant
 hypothesis
 Again necessarily best hypothesis simple way connect features probability relevance
 combination function
 next task estimate parameters function cache applied
 without knowing beta values harder apply function
 let estimate beta values
 All right let take look simple example
 example three features
 One BM25 score document query
 One PageRank score document might might depend query
 might topic-sensitive PageRank depend query
 Otherwise general PageRank really depend query
 BM25 score anchor test document
 feature values particular document query pair
 case document D1 judgment says relevant
 Here another training instance feature values case relevant
 oversimplified case two instances sufficient illustrate point
 use maximum likelihood estimator actually estimate parameters
 Basically predict relevance status document based feature values
 That given observed feature values
 Can predict relevance course prediction using function
 hypothesize probability relevance related features way
 values beta predict relevance well
 What mean predicting relevance well Well mean first case D1 expression right give high values
 fact hope gave value close 1
 Why Because relevant document
 On hand second case D2 hope value small right
 Why Because non-relevant document
 let mathematically expressed
 similar expressing probability document talking probability words talking probability relevance 1 0
 probability document relevant feature values Well expression
 need plug Xi
 get
 exactly seen replaced Xi specific values
 example


 different feature values combine particular way
 beta values still unknown
 gives probability document relevant assume model
 Okay want maximize probability since relevant document
 What second document Well want compute probability prediction non-relevant
 mean compute 1 minus expression since expression actually probability relevance
 compute non-relevance relevance 1 minus probability relevance
 Okay whole expression probability predicting two relevance values
 One 1 one 0
 whole equation probability observing 1 observing 0
 Of course probability depends beta values
 goal adjust beta values make whole thing reach maximum make large possible
 means compute
 beta parameter values maximize whole likelihood expression
 means look function choose betas make large possible make large possible equivalent say make part small possible
 precisely want
 training know beta values
 function well-defined
 Once beta values known completely specified
 new query new document simply compute features pair
 use formula generate ranking score
 scoring function used rank documents particular query
 basic idea learning rank
