 summarize discussion recommender systems sense filtering task recommender task easy sense task actually difficult
 easy user expectation low
 case system takes initiative push information user
 user really make effort recommendation better nothing
 All right
 unless recommend noise items useless documents
 recommend useful information users generally appreciate sense easy
 However filtering actually much harder task retrieval make binary decision ca afford waiting lot items whether one item better others
 make decision item
 Think news filtering
 As soon news enough decide whether news interesting user
 wait days well even make accurate recommendation relevant news utility significantly decreased
 Another reason hard data sparseness think learning problem
 Collaborative filtering example purely based learning past ratings
 many ratings really much right yeah mentioned cold start problem
 actually serious serious problem
 course strategies proposed soft problem different strategies use alleviate problem
 use example user information asses similarity instead using preferences users items give additional information available user etc
 talk two strategies filtering task
 One content-based look items collaborative filtering look Use similarity
 obviously combined practical system
 imagine generally combined
 give hybrid strategy filtering
 could recall talked push versus pull two strategies getting access text data
 recommender system easy help users push mode search engines serving users pull mode
 Obviously two combined combined
 two system support user multiple mode information access
 future could anticipate system useful user
 either active research area lot new algorithms proposed time
 particular new algorithms tend use lot context information
 context could context user could context user
 Items
 items isolated
 They connected many ways
 users might form social network well rich context leverage order really solve problem well active research area machine learning algorithms applied
 Here additional readings handbook called Recommender Systems collection lot good articles give overview number specific approaches recommender systems
