 summary course
 map shows major topics covered course
 key high-level take-away messages
 First talked natural language content analysis
 Here main take-away messages natural language processing foundation text retrieval currently NLP robust enough battle wars generally main method used modern search engines
 often sufficient search tasks obviously complex search tasks need deeper natural language processing techniques
 talked high level strategies text access talked push versus pull
 pull talked querying versus browsing
 general future search engines integrate techniques provide math involved information access
 talk number issues related search engines
 talked search problem
 framed ranking problem
 talked number retrieval methods
 start overview vector space model probabilistic model talked vector space model depth
 later talked language modeling approach probabilistic model
 many take-away message modeling retrieval function tend look similar generally use various heuristics
 Most important ones TF-IDF weighting document length normalization
 TF often transformed sub media transformation function
 talked implement retrieval system main techniques talked construct inverted index prepare system answer query quickly
 talked faster search using inverted index
 talked evaluate text retrieval system mainly introduced Cranfield Evaluation Methodology
 important evaluation methodology applied many tasks
 talked major evaluation measures
 important measures search engine MAP mean average precision nDCG Summarize discount accumulative gain precision recall two basic measures
 talked feedback techniques
 talked Rocchio Vector Space Model mixture model language modeling approach
 Feedback important technique especially considering opportunity learning lot pixels Web
 talked Web search
 talked use parallel scene solve scalability issue scene use net reduce
 Then talked use linking permission model app improve search
 talked page rank hits major hours analyzing links Web
 talked learning rank
 use machine learning combine multiple features improvement scoring
 Not effectiveness improved using approach improve robustness
 ranking function easy expand search engine
 features promote page
 finally talked future Web search
 About major reactions might future improving count regeneration engines
 finally talked recommended systems systems increment push mode
 talk two approaches one content-based one collaborative filtering combined together
 obvious missing piece picture user user interface important component search engine
 Even though current search interface relatively simple actually done lot studies user interfaces visualization example
 topic learn reading book
 excellent book kinds studies search using face
 want know topics talked read additional readings listed
 short course manage cover basic topics text retrievals search engines
 resources provide additional information advanced topics give thorough treatment topics talked
 main source Synthesis Digital Library lot short textbook textbooks long tutorials
 They tend provide lot information explain topic
 lot series related cause
 One information concepts retrieval services
 One human langauge technology
 yet another artificial intelligence machine learning
 There major journals conferences listed tend lot research papers need topic course
 finally information resources Including readings tool kits etc check URL
 taken text mining course data mining specialization series naturally next step take course
 As picture shows mine big text data generally need two kinds techniques
 One text retrieval covered course
 techniques help convert raw big text data small relevant text data actually needed specific application
 human plays important role mining text data text data written humans consume
 involving humans process data mining important course covered various strategies help users get access relevant data
 techniques always essential text mining system help provide prominence help users interpret inner patterns user define text data mining
 general user go back original data better understand patterns
 text mining cause rather text mining analytics course dealing user following information
 second step picture convert text data actionable knowledge
 helping users digest found information find patterns reveal knowledge
 text knowledge used application systems help decision making help user finish task
 taken course natural step natural next step take course
 Thank taking course
 hope fun found course useful
 look forward interacting future opportunity
