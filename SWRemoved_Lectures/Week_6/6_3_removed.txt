 There many Munster learning algorithms regression based approaches generally attempt direct optimizer retrieval method
 Like MAP nDCG
 Note optimization object function seen previous slide directly related retrieval measure
 By maximizing prediction one zero necessarily optimize ranking documents
 One imagine prediction may bad
 let say around

 kind middle zero one two documents
 ranking wrong might larger value E2 E1
 wo good retrieval perspective even though function bad
 contrast might another case predicted values around
 said
 objective function error larger
 get order two documents correct actually better result
 new advanced approaches try correct problem
 Of course challenge optimization problem harder solve
 researchers posed many solutions problem read references end know approaches
 learning ranked approaches general
 accounts applied many ranking problems retrieval problem
 people go recommender systems computational advertising summarization many others probably encounter applications
 To summarize talked using machine learning combine much features including ranking results
 Actually use machine learning information retrieval started since many decades ago
 example Rocchio feedback approach talked earlier machine learning approach prior relevance feedback
 recent use machine learning driven changes environment applications retrieval systems
 First mostly freedom availability lot training data form critical available
 data provide lot useful knowledge relevance machine learning methods applied leverage list
 Secondly freedom need combining many features features available web naturally used improved scoring
 combining improve robustness ranking desired combating spams
 Modern search engines use kind machine learning techniques combine many features optimize ranking major feature commercial engines Google Bing
 topic learning rank still active research topic community expect new results development next years perhaps
 Here additional readings give information learning rank works advanced methods
