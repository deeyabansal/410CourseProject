 collaborative filtering
 discussion recommended systems
 particular look approach collaborative filtering
 seen slide talked two strategies answer basic question user U item X previous looked item similarity content-based filtering
 look user similarity
 different strategy called collaborative filtering
 first collaborative filtering make filtering decisions individual user based judgements uses
 say infer individual interest preferences similar users
 general idea following
 Given user u first find similar users U1
 predict use preferences based preferences similar users U1
 user similarity judged based similarity preferences common set items
 exact content item really matter
 look relation users items
 means approach general
 applied items text objects
 approach work well following assumptions
 First users interest similar preferences
 Second users similar preferences probably share interest
 example interest user information retrieval infer user probably favor SIGIR papers
 interested information retrieval researching probably favor SIGIR papers
 That assumption make
 assumption true help collaborative filtering work well
 assume people favor See SIGIR papers infer interest probably information retrieval
 simple examples seems make sense many cases assumption actually make sense
 another assumption make sufficiently large number user preferences available
 example lot ratings users movies indicate preferences movies
 lot data cluttered filtering effective
 problem often called cold start problem
 That means many preferences available system could fully take advantage collaborative filtering yet
 let look filtering problem formal way
 picture shows general considering lot users showing users U1
 considering number objects
 Let say n objects order O1 On
 assume users able judge objects user could example give ratings items
 For example items could movies could products users give ratings 1 5
 shown ratings available combinations
 users watched movies rated movies obviously wo able watch movies users may actually watch movies
 general small symmetrics
 many items many entries unknown values
 interesting could potentially infer value element matrix based values
 essential question collaborative filtering assume unknown function
 That map pair user object rating
 observed sum values function
 want infer value function pairs available
 similar machinery problems know values function training data set
 hope predict values function test data function approximation
 pick function based observed ratings
 setup
 many approaches solving problem
 fact active research area reason special conferences dedicated problem major conference devoted problem
