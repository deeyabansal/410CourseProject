 There interesting challenges threshold learning filtering problem
 show historical data collect filtering system scores status relevance
 first one score
 relevant
 second one relevant separate
 Of course lot documents know status never delivered user
 judgements documents delivered user
 random sample sensitive data
 kind biased creates difficultly learning
 Secondly general little labeled data relevant data challenging machine learning approaches typically require training data
 extreme case beginning even labeled data well
 system make decision difficult problem beginning
 Finally issue exploration versus exploitation tradeoff
 means want explore document space little bit user might interested documents data labeled
 words explore space user interests testing whether user might interested documents currently matching user interests well
 Well could lower threshold little bit deliver near misses user user respond user respond extra document
 tradeoff one hand want explore hand want really explore much deliver non-relevant Information
 exploitation means exploit learn user
 Let say know user interested particular topic want deviate much deviate exploit good
 might miss opportunity learn another interest user
 dilemma
 difficulty problem solve
 solve problems general think one use empirical utility optimization strategy
 strategy basically optimize threshold based historical data seen previous slide
 Right compute utility training data candidate score threshold
 Pretend cut point
 What cut different scoring threshold point happen What utility Since training data kind compute utility know relevant status assume know relevant status based approximation click-throughs
 choose threshold gives maximum utility training data
 course account exploration talked
 difficulty biased training sample mentioned
 general get upper bound true optimal threshold threshold might actually lower
 possible could discarded item might actually interesting user
 solve problem Well generally said low threshold explore little bit
 particular approach called beta-gamma threshold learning
 idea falling
 show ranked list training documents seen far ranked positions
 axis show utility course function depends specify coefficients utility function imagine depending cutoff position utility
 Suppose cut position utility
 For example identify cutting cutoff point
 optimal point theta optimal point achieve maximum utility chosen threshold
 zero utility threshold
 cutoff utility zero
 What mean That means lower threshold little bit reach threshold
 utility lower still non-active least right high optimal utility
 gives safe point explore threshold explained desirable explore interest space
 desirable lower threshold based training
 means general want set threshold somewhere range
 Let say use alpha control deviation optimal utility point
 formula threshold interpolation zero utility threshold optimal utility threshold
 question set alpha deviate optimal utility point Well depend multiple factors one way solve problem encourage threshold mechanism explore zero point safe point necessarily reach way zero point
 Rather use parameters define alpha specifically follows
 beta parameter control deviation optimal threshold based accounting over-fitting training data let say adjustment factor
 interesting gamma parameter
 Here formula gamma controlling inference number examples training set
 formula N denotes number training examples becomes bigger actually encourage less exploration
 words small try explore
 means seen examples sure whether exhausted space interest
 need explore seen many examples user many feel probably explore
 gives beta gamma exploration right
 examples seen less exploration need
 threshold closer optimal threshold basic idea approach
 approach actually working well evaluation studies particularly effective
 work arbitrary utility appropriate lower bound
 explicitly addresses exploration-exploitation tradeoff kind uses zero utility threshold point safeguard exploration-exploitation tradeoff
 never explore zero utility point
 take analogy gambling want risk losing money
 safe spend really conservative strategy exploration
 problem course approach purely heuristic zero utility lower boundary often conservative course advance machine learning approaches proposed solving problems active research area
 summarize two strategies recommended systems filtering systems one content based looking item similarity collaborative filtering looking user similarity
 covered content-based filtering approach
 next talk collaborative filtering
 content-based filtering system generally solve several problems relative filtering decision learning etc
 system actually built based search engine system adding threshold mechanism adding adaptive learning algorithm allow system learn long term feedback user
