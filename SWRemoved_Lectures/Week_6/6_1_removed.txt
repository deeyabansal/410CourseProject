 Learning Rank
 talking web search
 particular talk using machine learning combine different features improve ranking function
 question address combine many features generate single ranking function optimize search results previous lectures talked number ways rank documents
 talked retrieval models BM25 Query Light Code
 They generate based course matching documents query
 talked link based approaches page rank give additional scores help improve ranking
 question combine features potentially many features ranking useful ranking webpages improve accuracy improve robustness ranking function
 easy spammer perturb one features promote page
 general idea learning rank use machine learning combine features optimize weights different features generate optimal ranking function
 assume given query document pair Q D define number features
 features vary content based features score document respect query according retrieval function BM25 Query Light Hold punitive commands machine PL2 etcetera
 link based score page rank score
 application retrieval models ink text page
 Those types descriptions links point page
 clues whether document relevant
 even include feature whether URL tilde might indicator home page entry page
 features combined together generate ranking function
 question course
 How combine approach simply hypothesize probability document relevant query function features
 hypothesize probability relevance related features particular form function parameters
 parameters control influence different features final relevance
 course assumption
 Whether assumption really makes sense big question empirically evaluate function
 hypothesizing relevance related features particular way combine features generate potential powerful ranking function robust ranking function
 Naturally next question estimate parameters How know features higher weight features lower weight task training learning approach use training data
 Those data charted users already know relevant judgments
 already know documents ranked high queries
 information based real judgments users approximated using click information assume clicked documents better skipped documents clicked documents relevant skipped documents non-relevant
 general fit hypothesize ranking function training data meaning try optimize retrieval accuracy training data
 adjust parameters optimize performance functioning training data terms measures MAP NDCG
 training date look table tuples
 Each tuple three elements query document judgement
 looks much relevance judgement talked evaluation retrieval systems
