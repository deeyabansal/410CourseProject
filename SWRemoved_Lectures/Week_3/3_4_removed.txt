 average precision computer one
 one query
 generally experiment many different queries avoid variance across queries
 Depending queries use might make different conclusions
 Right better using queries
 use queries take average average precision queries
 Well naturally
 Think arithmetic mean always tend think way
 give called `` Mean Average Position '' MAP
 case take arithmetic mean average precisions several queries topics
 mentioned another good call
 talked different ways combining precision recall
 conclude arithmetic mean good MAP measure

 think alternative ways aggregating numbers
 Do automatically assume though
 Let take arithmetic mean average position queries
 Let think best way aggregating
 think different ways naturally probably able think another way geometric mean
 call kind average gMAP
 another way
 think two different ways
 Of thing
 natural question ask one better
 use MAP gMAP Again important question
 Imagine testing new algorithm comparing ways old algorithms made search engine
 tested multiple topics
 got average precision topics
 thinking looking overall performance
 take average
 strategy use first think question well make difference Can think scenarios using one make difference That give different rankings methods
 means depending way average detect
 Average average positions
 get different conclusions
 makes question becoming even important
 Right one use Well look difference
 Different ways aggregating average position
 realize arithmetic mean sum dominating large values
 large value mean means query relatively easy
 high pres average position
 Whereas gMAP tends affected low values
 queries good performance
 average precision low
 think improving search engine difficult queries gMAP preferred right On hand want
 Have improved lot
 Over kinds queries particular popular queries might easy want make perfect maybe MAP preferred
 answer depends users users tasks pref preferences
 point think multiple ways solve problem compare think carefully differences
 one makes sense
 Often one might make sense one situation another might make sense different situation
 important pick situations one preferred
 As special case mean average position think case precisely one rank document
 happens often example called known item search
 Where know target page let say find Amazon homepage
 one relevant document hope find
 That call `` known item search ''
 case precisely one relevant document
 Or another application question answering maybe one answer
 Are
 rank answers goal rank one particular answer top right case easily verify average position basically boil reciprocal rank
 That 1 r r rank position single relevant document
 document ranked top 1 1 reciprocal rank
 ranked second 1 2
 Et cetera
 take average average precision reciprocal rank set topics give something called mean reciprocal rank
 popular measure
 For item search know problem one relevant item
 r actually meaningful
 r basically indicating much effort user make order find relevant document
 ranked top low effort make little effort
 ranked 100 actually read presumably 100 documents order find
 sense r meaningful measure reciprocal rank take reciprocal r instead using r directly
 natural question simply using r imagine design ratio measure performance random system one relevant item
 might thought using r directly measure
 After measures user effort right think take average large number topics
 Again make difference
 Right one single topic using r using 1 r make difference

 Larger r corresponds small 1 r right difference show show many topics
 think average Mean Reciprocal Rank versus average
 What difference Do difference difference change oath systems
 conclusion
 turns actually big difference think want think pause video
 Basically difference take directory
 Again dominated large values
 values Those basically large values indicate lower ranked results
 That means relevant items rank low list
 sum average dominated
 Where relevant documents ranked lower portion ranked
 users perspective care highly ranked documents
 taking transformation using reciprocal rank
 Here emphasize difference top
 know think difference 1 2 make big difference 1 r think 100 1 wo make much difference use
 use big difference 100 let say 1,000 right
 desirable
 On hand 1 2 wo make much difference
 yet another case may multiple choices thing need figure one makes sense
 summarize showed precision-recall curve
 Can characterize overall accuracy ranked list
 emphasized actual utility ranked list depends many top ranked results user actually examine
 Some users examine
 Than others
 An average person uses standard measure comparing two ranking methods
 combines precision recall sensitive rank every random document
