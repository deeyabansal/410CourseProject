 mine text data social network context
 discussing contextual text mining
 particular look social network others context
 first motivation using network context analysis text context text article form network
 For example authors research articles might form collaboration networks
 authors social media content might form social networks
 For example Twitter people might follow
 Or Facebook people might claim friends others etc
 context connects content others
 Similarly locations associated text connected form geographical network
 general imagine metadata text data form kind network relations
 benefit jointly analyzing text social network context network context general
 use network impose constraints topics text
 example reasonable assume authors connected collaboration networks tend write similar topics
 heuristics used guide analyzing topics
 Text help characterize content associated subnetwork
 say kinds data network text help
 example difference opinions expressed two subnetworks reviewed type joint analysis
 briefly could use model called network supervised topic model
 slide give general ideas
 next slide give details
 general part course enough time cover frontier topics detail
 provide references allow read topic know details
 still useful know general ideas
 know know might able use
 general idea network supervised topic model following
 Let start viewing regular topic models
 Like LDA sorting optimization problem
 Of course case optimization objective function likelihood function
 often use maximum likelihood estimator obtain parameters
 parameters give useful information want obtain text data
 For example topics
 want maximize probability tests given parameters generally denoted number
 main idea incorporating network think constraints imposed based network
 general idea use network impose constraints model parameters lambda
 For example text adjacent nodes network similar cover similar topics
 Indeed many cases tend cover similar topics
 may able smooth topic distributions graph network adjacent nodes similar topic distributions
 share common distribution topics
 Or slight variations topic distributions coverage
 technically simply add network use regularizers likelihood objective function shown
 instead optimize probability test data given parameters lambda optimize another function
 function combines likelihood regularizer function called R
 regularizer defines parameters lambda Network
 tells basically kind parameters preferred network constraint perspective
 easily effect implementing idea imposing prior model parameters
 Only necessary probabilistic model idea
 combine two one single objective function
 advantage idea quite general
 Here top model generative model text
 PLSA LEA current topic models
 similarly network network
 Any graph connects text objects
 regularizer regularizer
 flexible capturing different heuristics want capture
 finally function F vary many different ways combine
 general idea actually quite quite powerful
 offers general approach combining different types data single optimization framework
 general idea really applied problem
 paper reference particular instantiation called NetPLSA started
 case instantiating PLSA incorporate simple constraint imposed network
 prior neighbors network must similar topic distribution
 They must cover similar topics similar ways
 basically says English
 technically modified objective function
 Let define texts actually network graph G
 look formula actually recognize part fairly familiarly
 Because fairly familiar
 recognize part likelihood test given topic model Well look part precisely PLSA log-likelihood want maximize estimate parameters PLSA alone
 second equation shows additional constraints parameters
 particular measure difference topic coverage node u node
 two adjacent nodes network
 want distributions similar
 computing square differences want minimize difference
 note negative sign front sum whole sum
 makes possible find parameters maximize PLSA log-likelihood
 That means parameters fit data well respect constraint network
 negative sign mentioned
 Because negative sign maximize object function actually minimize statement term
 look picture results weight edge u v
 space network
 weight says well two nodes strong collaborators researchers
 two strong connections two people social network
 weight
 Then means important topic coverages similar
 basically says
 finally parameter lambda
 new parameter control influence network constraint
 easily lambda set 0 go back standard PLSA
 lambda set larger value let network influence estimated models
 effect basically PLSA
 try make topic coverages two nodes strongly connected similar
 ensure coverages similar
 several results paper
 slide shows record results using PLSA
 data DBLP data bibliographic data research articles
 experiments using four communities applications
 IR information retrieval
 DM stands data mining
 ML machinery web
 There four communities articles hoping topic mining help uncover four communities
 assembled topics seen generated PLSA
 PLSA unable generate four communities correspond intuition
 reason mixed together many words shared communities
 easy use four topics separate
 use topics perhaps coherent topics
 interesting use NetPLSA network collaboration network case authors used impose constraints
 case use four topics
 Ned Pierre said gave much meaningful topics
 topics correspond well four communities
 first information retrieval
 second data mining
 Third machine learning
 fourth web
 separation mostly influence network leverage collaboration network information
 Essentially people form collaborating network kind assumed write similar topics
 coherent topics
 listen text data alone based occurrences wo get coherent topics
 Even though topic model PLSA LDA able pick co-occurring words
 general topics generate represent words co-occur
 still generate coherent results NetPLSA showing network contest useful
 similar model could useful characterize content associated subnetwork collaborations
 general view text mining context network treat text living rich information network environment
 means connect related data together big network
 text data associated lot structures network
 For example text data associated nodes network basically discussed NetPLSA
 text data associated age well paths even subnetworks
 way represent texts big environment context information powerful
 Because allows analyze data information together
 general analysis text using entire network information related text data
 one suggested reading
 paper NetPLSA find details model make model
