 contextual text mining
 Contextual text mining related multiple kinds knowledge mine text data 'm showing
 related topic mining make topics associated context time location
 similarly make opinion mining contextualized making opinions connected context
 related text based prediction allows combine non-text data text data derive sophisticated predictors prediction problem
 specifically interested contextual text mining Well first text often rich context information
 include direct context meta-data indirect context
 direct context grow meta-data time location authors source text data
 almost always available
 Indirect context refers additional data related meta-data
 example office obtain additional context social network author author age
 Such information general directly related text yet process connect
 There could text data source one text connected text well
 general related data regarded context
 could removed rated context
 use What text context used Well context used partition text data many interesting ways
 almost allow partition text data ways need
 important allows interesting comparative analyses
 general provides meaning discovered topics associate text context
 illustration context regarded interesting ways partitioning text data
 showed research papers published different years
 On different venues different conference names listed bottom SIGIR ACL etc
 text data partitioned many interesting ways context
 context includes time conference venues
 perhaps include variables well
 let partition interesting ways
 First treat paper separate unit
 case paper ID paper context
 independent
 treat papers within 1998 one group possible availability time
 partition data way
 allow compare topics example different years
 Similarly partition data based menus
 get SIGIR papers compare papers rest
 Or compare SIGIR papers KDD papers ACL papers
 partition data obtain papers written authors
 course uses additional context authors
 allow compare subset another set papers written seen countries
 Or obtain set papers text mining compared papers another topic
 note partitionings intersected generate even complicated partitions
 general enables discovery knowledge associated different context needed
 particular compare different contexts
 often gives lot useful knowledge
 For example comparing topics time trends topics
 Comparing topics different contexts reveal differences two contexts
 many interesting questions require contextual text mining
 Here list specific ones
 For example topics getting increasing attention recently data mining research answer question obviously need analyze text context time
 time context case
 Is difference responses people different regions event event broad answer question
 case course location context
 What common research interests two researchers case authors context
 Is difference research topics published authors USA outside case context include authors affiliation location
 beyond author
 need look additional information connected author
 Is difference opinions topics expressed one social network another case social network authors topic context
 Other topics news data correlated sudden changes stock prices
 case use time series stock prices context
 What issues mattered 2012 presidential campaign presidential election case time serves context
 list go
 Basically contextual text mining many applications
