 continued discussion Latent Aspect Rating Analysis
 Earlier talked solve problem LARA two stages
 first segmentation different aspects
 use latent regression model learn aspect ratings later weight
 possible develop unified generative model solving problem model generational over-rating based text
 model generation text natural solution use topic model
 given entity assume aspects described word distributions
 Topics
 use topic model model generation reviewed text
 assume words review text drawn distributions
 way assumed generating model PRSA
 plug latent regression model use text predict overrating
 means first predict aspect rating combine aspect weights predict overall rating
 give unified generated model model generation text overall ready condition text
 time discuss model detail many cases part cause discuss cutting edge topics reference site find details
 'm show simple results get using kind generated models
 First rating decomposition
 decomposed ratings three hotels overall rating
 look overall rating ca really tell much difference hotels
 decomposing ratings aspect ratings hotels higher ratings dimensions value others might score better dimensions location
 give detailed opinions aspect level
 ground-truth shown parenthesis allows whether prediction accurate
 always accurate mostly still reflecting trends
 second result compare different reviewers hotel
 table shows decomposed ratings two reviewers hotel
 Again high level overall ratings
 look overall ratings really get much information difference two reviewers
 decompose ratings clearly high scores different dimensions
 shows model review differences opinions different reviewers detailed understanding help understand better reviewers better feedback hotel
 something interesting sense byproduct
 problem formulation really
 design generating model component
 sentimental weights words different aspects
 highly weighted words versus negatively loaded weighted words four dimensions
 Value rooms location cleanliness
 top words clearly make sense bottom words make sense
 shows approach learn sentiment information directly data
 kind lexicon useful general word long let say may different sentiment polarities different context
 say battery life laptop long positive
 say rebooting time laptop long bad right even reviews product laptop word long ambiguous could mean positive could mean negative
 kind lexicon learn using kind generated models show whether word positive particular aspect
 clearly useful fact lexicon directly used tag reviews hotels tag comments hotels social media Tweets
 interesting since almost completely unsupervised well assuming reviews whose overall rating available allow learn form potentially larger amount data internet reach sentiment lexicon
 results validate preference words
 Remember model infer wether reviewer cares service price
 know whether inferred weights correct poses difficult challenge evaluation
 show interesting way evaluating
 What prices hotels different cities prices hotels favored different groups reviewers
 top ten reviewers highest inferred value aspect ratio
 example value versus location value versus room etcetera
 top ten reviewers highest ratios measure
 means reviewers tend put lot weight value compared dimensions
 means really emphasize value
 bottom ten hand reviewers
 lowest ratio mean Well means reviewers put higher weights aspects value
 people cared another dimension care much value sense least compared top ten group
 ratios computer based inferred weights model
 average prices hotels favored top ten reviewers indeed much cheaper favored bottom ten
 provides indirect way validating inferred weights
 means weights random
 They actually meaningful
 comparison average price three cities actually top ten tend average price whereas bottom half care lot things service room condition tend hotels higher prices average
 results build lot interesting applications
 For example direct application generate rated aspect summary decomposition generated summaries aspect
 positive sentences negative sentences aspect
 informative original review overall rating review text
 Here results aspects covered reviews ratings
 mp3 reviews results show model discover interesting aspects
 Commented low overall ratings versus higher overall per ratings
 care different aspects
 Or comment different aspects
 help discover example consumers ' trend appreciating different features products
 For example one might discovered trend people tend larger screens cell phones light weight laptop etcetera
 Such knowledge useful manufacturers design next generation products
 Here interesting results analyzing users rating behavior
 average weights along different dimensions different groups reviewers
 left side weights viewers expensive hotels
 They gave expensive hotels 5 Stars average rates tend service
 suggests people expensive hotels good service surprising
 That another way validate inferred weights
 look right side look column 5 Stars
 reviewers cheaper hotels gave cheaper hotels five stars
 As expected put weight value cheaper hotels
 look expensive hotels cheaper hotels tended weights condition room cleanness
 shows using model infer information hard obtain even read reviews
 Even read reviews hard infer preferences emphasis
 case text mining algorithms go beyond humans review interesting patterns data
 course useful
 compare different hotels compare opinions different consumer groups different locations
 course model general
 applied reviews overall ratings
 useful technique support lot text mining applications
 Finally results applying model personalized ranking recommendation entities
 infer reviewers weights different dimensions allow user actually say care
 example query shows 90 % weight value 10 % others
 means care aspect
 care getting cheaper hotel
 My emphasis value dimension
 query use reviewers believe similar preference recommend hotels
 How know Well infer weights reviewers different aspects
 find reviewers whose weights precise course inferred rates similar
 use reviewers recommend hotels call personalized rather query specific recommendations
 non-personalized recommendations shown top top results generally much higher price lower group reviewer cared value dictated query tended really favor low price hotels
 yet another application technique
 shows text mining understand users better
 handle users better solve users better
 summarize discussion opinion mining general important topic lot applications
 text sentiment analysis readily done using text categorization
 standard technique tends enough
 need enriched feature implementation
 need consider order categories
 talk ordinal regression problem
 assume generating models powerful mining latent user preferences
 particular generative model mining latent regression
 embed interesting preference information send weights words model result learn useful information fitting model data
 approaches proposed evaluated
 For product reviews context opinion holder opinion target clear
 easy analyze
 course lot practical applications
 opinion mining news social media important difficult analyzing review data mainly opinion holders opinion targets interested
 calls natural management processing techniques uncover accurately
 Here suggested readings
 first two small books use topic find lot discussion variations problem techniques proposed solving problem
 next two papers generating models rating aspect rating analysis
 first one solving problem using two stages second one unified model topic model integrated regression model solve problem using unified model
