 specific technique Contextual Text Mining called Contextual Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis
 discussing Contextual Text Mining
 introduce Contextual Probablitistic Latent Semantic Analysis exchanging POS contextual text mining
 Recall contextual text mining hope analyze topics text consideration context associate topics property context interesting
 approach contextual probabilistic latent semantic analysis CPLSA main idea express add interesting context variables generating model
 Recall generate text generally assume start wIth topics assemble words topics
 add context variables coverage topics content topics tied context
 Or words let context Influence coverage content topic
 consequences enable discover contextualized topics
 Make topics interesting meaningful
 Because topics interpreted specifically particular context interested
 For example particular time period
 As extension PLSA model CPLSA following changes
 Firstly model conditional likelihood text given context
 That clearly suggests generation text depend context allows bring context generative model
 Secondly makes two specific assumptions dependency topics context
 One assume depending context depending different time periods different locations assume different views topic different versions word descriptions characterize topic
 assumption allows discover different variations topic different contexts
 assume topic coverage depends context
 That means depending time location might cover topics differently
 Again dependency allow capture association topics specific contexts
 still use EM algorithm solve problem parameter estimation
 case estimated parameters naturally contain context variables
 particular lot conditional probabilities topics given certain context
 allows contextual text mining
 basic idea
 time introduce model detail references look know detail
 Here want explain high level ideas detail
 Particularly want explain generation process
 Of text data context associated model
 assume still multiple topics
 For example topics might represent themes government response donation Or city New Orleans
 example context Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans
 assume different views associated topics
 shown View 1 View 2 View 3
 Each view different version word distributions
 views tied context variables
 For example tied location Texas time July 2005 occupation author sociologist
 right side assume document context information
 time known July 2005
 location Texas etc
 context information hope model well
 model text
 one idea model variations top content various content
 gives different views water distributions
 bottom theme coverage top Coverage might vary according context case location Texas people might want cover red topics
 That New Orleans
 That visualized
 certain time period maybe Particular topic covered
 variation considered CPLSA
 generate searcher document With context first choose view
 view course could contexts
 Let say taken view depends time
 middle
 specific version word distributions
 probabilities words topic
 chosen view situation similar happened standard ( ( PRSA ) ) assume got word distribution associated topic right next choose coverage bottom choose particular coverage coverage fixed PLSA assigned particular document
 Each document one coverage distribution
 consider context distribution topics coverage Topics vary depending context influenced coverage
 example might pick particular coverage
 Let say case picked document specific coverage
 coverage word distributions generate document exactly way PLSA
 means use coverage choose topic choose one three topics
 Let say picked yellow topic
 Then draw word particular topic top
 Okay might get word government
 next time might choose different topic get donate etc
 Until generate words
 basically process PLSA
 main difference obtain coverage
 word distribution let context influence choice words extra switches tied contacts control choices different views topics choices coverage
 naturally model parameters estimate
 estimate parameters involve context able understand context specific views topics context specific coverages topics
 precisely want contextual text mining
 simple results
 From using model
 Not necessary exactly model similar models
 slide sample results comparing news articles Iraq War Afghanistan War
 30 articles Iraq wa r 26 articles Afghanistan war
 case goal review common topic
 covered sets articles differences variations topic two collections
 case context explicitly specified topic collection
 results show common theme corresponding Cluster 1 column
 common theme indicting United Nations involved Wars
 common topic covered sets articles
 indicated high probability words shown united nations
 know background course surprising topic indeed relevant wars
 look column interesting next two cells word distributions actually tell collection specific variations topic United Nations
 indicates Iraq War United Nations involved weapons factions whereas Afghanistan War involved maybe aid Northern Alliance
 different variation topic United Nations
 shows bringing context
 case different walls different collection texts
 topical variations tied contexts review differences coverage United Nations two wars
 similarly look second cluster Class two killing people surprising know background wars
 All wars involve killing people imagine familiar text collections
 lot text articles technique reveal common topics covered sets articles
 used review common topics multiple sets articles well
 look course column cluster two variations killing people corresponds different contexts another example results obtained blog articles Hurricane Katrina
 case visualization trends topics time
 top one shows temporal trends two topics
 One oil price one flooding city New Orleans
 topics obtained blog articles Hurricane Katrina
 people talk topics
 end teaching topics
 visualisation shows technique conditional distribution time
 Given topic
 allows plot conditional probability curve seeing
 initially two curves tracked well
 later topic New Orleans mentioned oil price
 turns time period another hurricane hurricane Rita hit region
 apparently triggered discussion flooding city
 bottom curve shows coverage topic flooding city block articles different locations
 shows shift coverage might related people migrating state Louisiana Texas example
 case time used context review trends topics
 additional results spacial patterns
 case topic government response
 criticism slow response government case Hurricane Katrina
 discussion covered different locations
 visualizations show coverage different weeks event
 initially covered mostly victim states South gradually spread locations
 week four shown bottom left pattern similar first week top left
 Hurricane Rita hit region
 technique allow use location context examine issues topics
 course moral completely general apply connections text
 To review spatial temporal patterns
 His view found another application kind model look use model event impact analysis
 looking research articles information retrieval
 IR particularly SIGIR papers
 topic focusing retrieval models
 top words high probability model left
 hope examine impact two events
 One start TREC Text Retrieval Conference
 major evaluation sponsored
 government launched 1992 around time
 known made impact topics research information retrieval
 publication seminal paper Croft Porte
 language model approach information retrieval
 known made high impact information retrieval research
 hope use kind model understand impact
 idea simply use time context
 use events divide time periods period
 For event another event
 compare differences topics
 variations etc
 case results show track study retrieval models mostly vector space model Boolean model etc
 Trec apparently study retrieval models involved lot words
 That seems suggest different retrieval tasks example email used enterprise search tasks subtopical retrieval another task later introduced Trec
 On bottom variations correlated propagation language model paper
 Before classic probability risk model logic model Boolean
 1998 clear dominance language model probabilistic models
 words language model estimation parameters etc
 technique use events context understand impact event
 Again technique generals use analyze impact event
 Here suggested readings
 first paper simple staging psi label cross-collection comparison
 perform comparative text mining allow extract common topics shared multiple collections
 variations collection
 second one main paper CPLSA model
 Was discussion lot applications
 third one lot details special temporal patterns Hurricane Katrina example
