 Text-Based Prediction
 start talking mining different kind knowledge slide
 Namely use text data infer values variables real world may directly related text
 Or remotely related text data
 different content analysis topic mining directly characterize content text
 different opinion mining sentiment analysis still characterizing mostly content
 Only focus subject content reflects know opinion holder
 provides limited review predict
 following lectures talk predict Information world
 How get sophisticated patterns text together kind data useful first take look big picture prediction data mining general call data mining loop
 picture seeing right multiple sensors including human sensors report seen real world form data
 Of course data form non-text data text data
 goal predict values important real world variables matter
 For example someone house condition weather etc
 variables important might want act
 might want make decisions based
 get data predicted values Well general first data mining analysis data
 Because general treat data collected prediction problem set
 much interested joint mining non-text text data combine data together
 analysis generally multiple predictors interesting variable
 call features
 features put predictive model actually predict value interesting variable
 allows change world
 basically general process making prediction based data including test data
 important emphasize human actually plays important role process
 Especially involvement text data
 human first involved mining data
 control generation features
 help understand text data text data created consumed humans
 Humans best consuming interpreting text data
 course lot text data machines help need text data mining
 Sometimes machines patterns lot data humans may
 general human play important role analyzing text data applications
 Next human must involved predictive model building adjusting testing
 particular lot domain knowledge problem prediction build predictive model
 next course predictive values variables humans involved taking actions change word make decisions based particular values
 finally interesting human could involved controlling sensors
 adjust sensors collect useful data prediction
 call data mining loop
 Because perturb sensors collect new data useful data obtain data prediction
 data generally help improve predicting accuracy
 loop humans recognize additional data need collected
 machines course help humans identify data collected next
 general want collect data useful learning
 actually subarea machine learning called active learning
 How identify data points helpful machine learning programs label right general loop data acquisition data analysis
 Or data mining prediction values
 take actions change word observe happens
 decide additional data collected adjusting sensors
 Or prediction arrows note additional data need acquire order improve accuracy prediction
 big picture actually general reflecting lot important applications big data
 useful keep mind looking text mining techniques
 text mining perspective interested text based prediction
 Of course sometimes texts alone make predictions
 useful prediction human behavior human preferences opinions
 general text data put together non-text data
 interesting questions first design effective predictors generate effective predictors text question addressed extent previous lectures talked kind features design text data
 addressed extent talking knowledge mine text
 example topic mining useful generate patterns topic based indicators predictors fed predictive model
 topics intermediate recognition text
 That allow design high level features predictors useful prediction variable
 may generated original text data provides much better implementation problem serves effective predictors
 similarly similar analysis lead predictors well
 data mining text mining algorithms used generate predictors
 question join mine text non-text data together question addressed yet
 following lectures address problem
 Because generate much enriched features prediction
 allows review lot interesting knowledge world
 patterns generated text non-text data sometimes already useful prediction
 put together many predictors really help improving prediction
 Basically text-based prediction actually serve unified framework combine many text mining analysis techniques
 Including topic mining content mining techniques segment analysis
 goal mainly evoke values real-world variables
 order achieve goal preparations
 subtasks
 one subtask could mine content text data topic mining
 could mine knowledge observer
 sentiment analysis opinion
 help provide predictors prediction problem
 course add non-text data directly predicted model non-text data helps provide context text analyst
 improves topic mining opinion analysis
 improvement often leads effective predictors problems
 enlarge space patterns opinions topics mine text discuss later
 joint analysis text non-text data actually understood two perspectives
 One perspective non-text help testimony
 Because non-text data provide context mining text data provide way partition data different ways
 leads number type techniques contextual types mining
 mine text context defined non-text data
 reference large body work direction
 need highlight next lectures
 perspective text data help non-text data mining well
 text data help interpret patterns discovered non-text data
 Let say discover frequent patterns non-text data
 use text data associated instances pattern occurs well text data associated instances pattern look
 gives two sets text data
 difference
 difference text data interpretable text content easy digest
 difference might suggest meaning pattern found non-text data
 helps interpret patterns
 technique called pattern annotation
 reference listed detail
 references mentioned
 first reference pattern annotation
 second Qiaozhu Mei dissertation contextual text mining
 contains large body work contextual text mining techniques
