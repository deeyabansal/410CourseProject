 specific examples ca part speech tagging still easy 100 % correctly
 example turned highway verses turned fan two offs actually somewhat differentness active categories difficult get complete parsing correct
 Again example man saw boy telescope actually difficult parse depending context
 Precise deep semantic analysis hard
 For example define meaning precisely difficult sentence John owns restaurant
 state summarized follows
 Robust general NLP tends shallow deep understanding scale
 For reason course techniques cover general shallow techniques analyzing text data mining text data generally based statistical analysis
 robust general category shallow analysis
 techniques advantage able applied text data natural topic
 downside give use deeper understanding text
 For rely deeper natural language analysis
 That typically require human effort annotate lot examples analysis computers use machine learning techniques learn training examples task
 practical applications generally combine two kinds techniques general statistical methods backbone basis
 applied text data
 top use humans take data use supervised machine learning tasks well especially important tasks bring humans loop analyze text data precisely
 course cover general statistical approaches generally require much human effort
 practically useful deeper analysis techniques require lot human effort annotate text
 summarize main points take first NLP foundation text mining
 obviously better understand text data better text mining
 Computers far able understand natural language
 Deep NLP requires common sense knowledge inferences
 Thus working limited domains feasible large scale text mining
 Shallow NLP based statistical methods done large scale main topic course generally applicable lot applications
 They sense useful techniques
 practice use statistical NLP basis humans help needed various ways
