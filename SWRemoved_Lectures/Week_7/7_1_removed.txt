 [ SOUND ] give overview Text Mining Analytics
 First let define term text mining term text analytics
 title course called Text Mining Analytics
 two terms text mining text analytics actually roughly
 really really distinguish use interchangeably
 reason chosen use terms title subtle difference look two phrases literally
 Mining emphasizes process
 gives error rate medical view problem
 Analytics hand emphasizes result problem mind
 look text data help solve problem
 said treat two terms roughly
 think literature probably find
 really distinguish course
 Both text mining text analytics mean want turn text data high quality information actionable knowledge
 cases problem dealing lot text data hope
 Turn text data something useful raw text data
 distinguish two different results
 One high-quality information actionable knowledge
 Sometimes boundary two clear
 want say little bit two different angles result text field mining
 case high quality information refer concise information topic
 Which might much easier humans digest raw text data
 For example might face lot reviews product
 concise form information concise summary major opinions features product
 Positive let say battery life laptop
 kind results useful help people digest text data
 minimize human effort consuming text data sense
 kind output actually knowledge
 Here emphasize utility information knowledge discover text data
 actionable knowledge decision problem actions take
 For example might able determine product appealing better choice shocking decision
 outcome could called actionable knowledge consumer take knowledge make decision act
 case text mining supplies knowledge optimal decision making
 two clearly distinguished necessarily make distinction
 Text mining related text retrieval essential component many text mining systems
 text retrieval refers finding relevant information large amount text data
 taught another separate MOOC text retrieval search engines
 Where discussed various techniques text retrieval
 taken MOOC find overlap
 useful To know background text retrieval understanding topics text mining
 taken MOOC fine MOOC text mining analytics repeat key concepts relevant text mining
 high level explain relation text retrieval text mining
 Text retrieval useful text mining two ways
 First text retrieval preprocessor text mining
 Meaning help turn big text data relatively small amount relevant text data
 Which often needed solving particular problem
 sense text retrieval helps minimize human effort
 Text retrieval needed knowledge provenance
 roughly corresponds interpretation text mining turning text data actionable knowledge
 Once find patterns text data actionable knowledge generally verify knowledge
 By looking original text data
 users text retrieval support go back original text data interpret pattern better understand analogy verify whether pattern really reliable
 high level introduction concept text mining relationship text mining retrieval
 Next let talk text data special kind data
 interesting view text data data generated humans subjective sensors
 slide shows analogy text data non-text data
 humans subjective sensors physical sensors network sensor thermometer
 general sensor monitor real world way
 sense signal real world report signal data various forms
 For example thermometer watch temperature real world report temperature particular format
 Similarly geo sensor sense location report
 location specification example form longitude value latitude value
 network sends monitor network traffic activities network reported
 Some digital format data
 Similarly think humans subjective sensors
 That observe real world perspective
 humans express observed form text data
 sense human actually subjective sensor sense happening world express observed form data case text data
 looking text data way advantage able integrate types data together
 indeed needed data mining problems
 looking general problem data mining
 general Be dealing lot data world related problem
 general dealing non-text data text data
 course non-text data usually produced physical senses
 non-text data different formats
 Numerical data categorical relational data multi-media data video speech
 non text data often important problems
 text data important mostly contain lot symmetrical content
 often contain knowledge users especially preferences opinions users
 treating text data data observed human sensors treat data together framework
 data mining problem basically turn data turn data actionable knowledge take advantage change real world course better
 means data mining problem basically taking lot data input giving actionable knowledge output
 Inside data mining module number different kind mining algorithms
 different kinds data generally need different algorithms mining data
 For example video data might require computer vision understand video content
 facilitate effective mining
 lot general algorithms applicable kinds data algorithms course useful
 Although particular kind data generally want develop special algorithm
 course cover specialized algorithms particularly useful mining text data
