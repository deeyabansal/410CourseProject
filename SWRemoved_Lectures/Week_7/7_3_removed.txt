 natural language content analysis
 Natural language content analysis foundation text mining
 first talk
 particular natural language processing factor present text data
 determines algorithms used analyze mine text data
 take look basic concepts natural language first
 'm explain concepts using similar example seen
 dog chasing boy playground
 simple sentence
 When read sentence think get meaning
 computer understand sentence computer go several steps
 First computer needs know words segment words English
 easy look space
 computer need know categories words syntactical categories
 example dog noun chasing verb boy another noun etc
 called Lexical analysis
 particular tagging words syntactic categories called part-of-speech tagging
 After computer needs figure relationship words
 dog form noun phrase
 On playground prepositional phrase etc
 certain way connected together order create meaning
 Some combinations may make sense
 called syntactical parsing syntactical analysis parsing natural language sentence
 outcome parse tree seeing
 That tells structure sentence know interpret sentence
 semantics yet
 order get meaning map phrases structures real world antithesis mind
 dog concept know boy concept know
 connecting phrases know understanding
 computer formally represent entities using symbols
 dog d1 means d1 dog
 Boy b1 means b1 refers boy etc
 represents chasing action predicate
 chasing predicate three arguments d1 b1 p1
 Which playground
 formal rendition semantics sentence
 Once reach level understanding might make inferences
 For example assume rule says someone chased person get scared infer boy might scared
 inferred meaning based additional knowledge
 finally might even infer sentence requesting person say sentence saying sentence
 purpose saying sentence
 called speech act analysis pragmatic analysis
 Which first use language
 case person saying may reminding another person bring back dog
 means saying sentence person actually takes action
 action make request
 slide clearly shows order really understand sentence lot things computer
 general hard computer everything especially want everything correctly
 difficult
 main reason natural language processing difficult designed make human communications efficient
 As result example lot common sense knowledge
 Because assume knowledge need encode knowledge
 That makes communication efficient
 keep lot ambiguities ambiguities words
 assume ability disambiguate word
 problem word mean possibly different things different context
 Yet computer difficult computer common sense knowledge
 computer confused indeed
 makes hard natural language processing
 Indeed makes hard every step slide showed earlier
 Ambiguity main killer
 Meaning every step multiple choices computer decide whats right choice decision difficult moment
 general need common sense reasoning order fully understand natural language
 computers yet
 That hard computers precisely understand natural language point
 specific examples challenges
 Think world-level ambiguity
 word design noun verb got ambiguous part speech tag
 Root multiple meanings mathematical sense square root plant
 Syntactic ambiguity refers different interpretations sentence terms structures
 example natural language processing actually interpreted two ways
 one ordinary meaning getting talking topic
 processing natural language
 another possible interpretation say language processing natural
 generally problem imagine computer determine structure computer make choice two
 Another classic example man saw boy telescope
 ambiguity lies question telescope called prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity
 Meaning attach prepositional phrase telescope
 Should modify boy Or modifying saw verb
 Another problem anaphora resolution
 John persuaded Bill buy TV
 Does refer John Bill Presupposition another difficulty
 He quit smoking implies smoked need knowledge order understand languages
 Because problems state art natural language processing techniques anything perfectly
 Even simplest part speech tagging still solve whole problem
 accuracy listed 97 % taken studies earlier
 studies obviously using particular data sets numbers really meaningful take context data set used evaluation
 show numbers mainly give sense accuracy well things
 mean data set accuracy precisely 97 %
 general parsing speech tagging fairly well although perfect
 Parsing difficult partial parsing meaning get phrases correct probably achieve 90 % better accuracy
 get complete parse tree correctly still difficult
 For semantic analysis aspects semantic analysis particularly extraction entities relations
 For example recognizing person location person person met place etc
 word sense extent
 occurrence root sentence refers mathematical sense etc
 Sentiment analysis another aspect semantic analysis
 That means tag senses generally positive talking product talking person
 Inference however hard generally big domain feasible limited domain
 generally difficult problem artificial intelligence
 Speech act analysis difficult probably specialized cases
 lot help humans annotate enough data computers learn
 slide shows computers far able understand natural language precisely
 explains text mining problem difficult
 Because rely mechanical approaches computational methods understand language precisely
 Therefore use whatever
 particular statistical machine learning method statistical analysis methods try get much meaning text possible
 later actually many algorithms indeed extract interesting model text even though really fully understand
 Meaning natural language sentences precisely
