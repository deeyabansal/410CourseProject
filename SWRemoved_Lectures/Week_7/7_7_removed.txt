 word association mining analysis
 talk mine associations words text
 example knowledge natural language mine text data
 Here outline
 first talk word association explain discovering relations useful finally talk general ideas mine word associations
 general two word relations quite basic
 One called paradigmatic relation
 syntagmatic relation
 B paradigmatic relation substituted
 That means two words paradigmatic relation semantic class syntactic class
 general replace one without affecting understanding sentence
 That means still valid sentence
 For example cat dog two words paradigmatic relation class animal
 general replace cat dog sentence sentence still valid sentence make sense
 Similarly Monday Tuesday paradigmatical relation
 second kind relation called syntagmatical relation
 case two words relation combined
 B syntagmatic relation combined sentence means two words semantically related
 example cat sit related cat sit somewhere
 Similarly car drive related semantically combined convey meaning
 However general replace cat sit sentence car drive sentence still get valid sentence meaning sentence become somewhat meaningless
 different paradigmatic relation
 two relations fact fundamental generalized capture basic relations units arbitrary sequences
 definitely generalized describe relations items language
 B words phrases example
 even complex phrases non-phrase
 think general problem sequence mining think units sequence data
 Then think paradigmatic relation relations applied units tend occur singular locations sentence sequence data elements general
 occur similar locations relative neighbors sequence
 Syntagmatical relation hand related co-occurrent elements tend show sequence
 two complimentary basic relations words
 interested discovering automatically text data
 Discovering worded relations many applications
 First relations directly useful improving accuracy many NLP tasks part knowledge language
 know two words synonyms example help lot tasks
 grammar learning done using techniques
 Because learn paradigmatic relations form classes words syntactic classes example
 learn syntagmatic relations able know rules putting together larger expression based component expressions
 learn structure go else
 Word relations useful many applications text retrieval mining
 For example search text retrieval use word associations modify query used introduce additional related words query make query effective
 often called query expansion
 Or use related words suggest related queries user explore information space
 Another application use word associations automatically construct top map browsing
 words nodes associations edges
 user could navigate one word another find information information space
 Finally word associations used compare summarize opinions
 For example might interested understanding positive negative opinions iPhone 6
 order look words strongly associated feature word battery positive versus negative reviews
 Such syntagmatical relations help show detailed opinions product
 discover associations automatically intuitions
 let first look paradigmatic relation
 Here essentially take advantage similar context
 simple sentences cat dog
 generally occur similar context definition paradigmatic relation
 On right side kind extracted expressly context cat dog small sample text data
 taken away cat dog sentences context
 course different perspectives look context
 For example look words occur left part context
 call left context
 What words occur cat dog case clearly dog cat similar left context
 generally say cat cat say dog dog
 makes similar left context
 Similarly look words occur cat dog call right context similar case
 Of course extreme case eats
 general many words course ca follow cat dog
 even look general context
 might include words sentence sentences around word
 even general context similarity two words
 suggestion discover paradigmatic relation looking similarity context words
 example think following questions
 How similar context cat context dog contrast similar context cat context computer intuitively imagine context cat context dog similar context cat context computer
 That means first case similarity value high context cat dog second similarity context cat computer low paradigmatic relationship imagine words occur computer general
 different words occur cat
 basic idea covering paradigmatic relation
 What syntagmatic relation Well explore correlated occurrences based definition syntagmatic relation
 Here sample text
 interested knowing words correlated verb eats words go eats
 look right side slide taken away two words around eats
 taken away word left word right sentence
 ask question words tend occur left eats words tend occur right eats thinking question help discover syntagmatic relations syntagmatic relations essentially captures correlations
 important question ask syntagmatical relation whenever eats occurs words tend occur question whether words tend co-occur together
 Meaning whenever eats tend words
 eats probably words often either
 intuition help discover syntagmatic relations
 consider example
 How helpful occurrence eats predicting occurrence meat Right
 All right knowing whether eats occurs sentence generally help predict whether meat occurs indeed
 eats occur sentence increase chance meat occur
 contrast look question bottom helpful occurrence eats predicting occurrence text Because eats text really related knowing whether eats occurred sentence really help predict weather text occurs sentence
 contrast question eats meat
 helps explain intuition behind methods discovering syntagmatic relations
 Mainly need capture correlation occurrences two words
 summarize general ideas discovering word associations following
 For paradigmatic relation present word context
 compute context similarity
 assume words high context similarity paradigmatic relation
 For syntagmatic relation count many times two words occur together context sentence paragraph document even
 compare co-occurrences individual occurrences
 assume words high co-occurrences relatively low individual occurrences syntagmatic relations attempt occur together usually occur alone
 Note paradigmatic relation syntagmatic relation actually closely related paradigmatically related words tend syntagmatic relation word
 They tend associated word suggests join discovery two relations
 general ideas implemented many different ways
 course wo cover cover least methods effective discovering relations
