 looking text mining problem closely problem similar general data mining except focusing text data
 text mining algorithms help turn text data actionable knowledge use real world especially decision making completing whatever tasks require text data support
 Because general many real world problems data mining tend kinds data non-textual
 general picture include non-text data well
 reason might concerned joint mining text non-text data
 course focus text mining touch joint analysis text data non-text data
 With problem definition look landscape topics text mining analytics
 slide shows process generating text data detail
 More specifically human sensor human observer look word perspective
 Different people looking world different angles pay attention different things
 person different times might pay attention different aspects observed world
 humans able perceive world perspective
 human sensor form view world
 called Observed World
 Of course different Real World perspective person taken often biased
 Observed World represented example entity-relation graphs general way using knowledge representation language
 general basically person mind world
 really know exactly looks course
 human express person observed using natural language English
 result text data
 Of course person could used different language express observed
 case might text data mixed languages different languages
 main goal text mining Is actually revert process generating text data
 hope able uncover aspect process
 Specifically think mining example knowledge language
 means looking text data English may able discover something English usage English patterns English
 one type mining problems result knowledge language may useful various ways
 look picture mine knowledge observed world
 much mining content text data
 look text data try get essence extracting high quality information particular aspect world interested
 For example everything said particular person particular entity
 regarded mining content describe observed world user mind person mind
 look imagine mine knowledge observer
 using text data infer properties person
 properties could include mood person sentiment person
 note distinguish observed word person text data ca describe person observed objective way
 description subjected sentiment general imagine text data contain factual descriptions world plus subjective comments
 possible text mining mine knowledge observer
 Finally look picture left side picture certainly say something real world
 Right indeed text mining infer real world variables
 often called predictive analytics
 want predict value certain interesting variable
 picture basically covered multiple types knowledge mine text general
 When infer real world variables could use results mining text data intermediate results help prediction
 For example mine content text data might generate summary content
 summary could used help predict variables real world
 course still generated original text data want emphasize often processing text data generate features help prediction important
 show results mining tasks including mining content text data mining knowledge observer helpful prediction
 fact non-text data could use non-text data help prediction course depends problem
 general non-text data important prediction tasks
 For example want predict stock prices changes stock prices based discussion news articles social media example using text data predict real world variables
 case obviously historical stock price data important prediction
 example non-text data useful prediction
 combine kinds data make prediction
 non-text data used analyzing text supplying context
 When look text data alone mostly looking content and/or opinions expressed text
 text data generally context associated
 For example time location associated text data
 useful context information
 context provide interesting angles analyzing text data
 For example might partition text data different time periods availability time
 analyze text data time period make comparison
 Similarly partition text data based locations meta data associated form interesting comparisons areas
 sense non-text data actually provide interesting angles perspectives text data analysis
 help make context-sensitive analysis content language usage opinions observer authors text data
 could analyze sentiment different contexts
 fairly general landscape topics text mining analytics
 course selectively cover topics
 actually hope cover general topics
 First cover natural language processing briefly understanding text data determines represent text data text mining
 Second talk mine word associations text data
 word associations form use lexical knowledge language
 Third talk topic mining analysis
 one way analyze content text useful ways analyzing content
 one useful techniques text mining
 Then talk opinion mining sentiment analysis
 regarded one example mining knowledge observer
 finally cover text-based prediction problems try predict real world variable based text data
 slide serves road map course
 use outline topics cover rest course
