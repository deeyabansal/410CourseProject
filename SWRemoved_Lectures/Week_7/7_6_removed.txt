 explained different text representation tends enable different analysis
 particular gradually add deeper analysis results represent text data
 open interesting representation opportunities analysis capacities
 table summarizes seen
 first column shows text representation
 second visualizes generality representation
 Meaning whether kind representation accurately text data
 third column shows enabled analysis techniques
 final column shows examples application achieved level representation
 let take look
 stream text processed stream processing algorithms
 robust general
 still interesting applications level
 For example compression text
 Does necessarily need know word boundaries
 Although knowing word boundaries might actually help
 Word base repetition important level representation
 quite general relatively robust indicating lot analysis techniques
 Such word relation analysis topic analysis sentiment analysis
 many applications enabled kind analysis
 For example thesaurus discovery discovering related words
 topic opinion related applications abounded
 example people might interesting knowing major topics covered collection texts
 case research literature
 scientists want know important research topics
 Or customer service people might want know major complaints customers mining e-mail messages
 business intelligence people might interested understanding consumers ' opinions products competitors ' products figure winning features products
 general many applications enabled representation level
 moving gradually add additional representations
 By adding syntactical structures enable course syntactical graph analysis
 use graph mining algorithms analyze syntactic graphs
 applications related kind representation
 For example stylistic analysis generally requires syntactical structure representation
 generate structure based features
 features might help classify text objects different categories looking structures sometimes classification
 accurate
 For example want classify articles different categories corresponding different authors
 want figure k authors actually written article generally need look syntactic structures
 When add entities relations enable techniques knowledge graph answers information network answers general
 analysis enable applications entities
 For example discovery knowledge opinions real world entities
 use level representation integrate everything anything scaled resources
 Finally add logical predicates enable large inference course
 useful integrating analysis scattered knowledge
 For example add ontology top extracted information text make inferences
 good example application enabled level representation knowledge assistant biologists
 program help biologist manage relevant knowledge literature research problem understanding functions genes
 computer make inferences hypothesis biologist might interesting
 For example whether gene certain function intelligent program read literature extract relevant facts compiling information extracting
 using logic system actually track answers researchers questioning genes related functions
 order support level application need go far logical representation
 course covering techniques mainly based word based representation
 techniques general robust widely used various applications
 fact virtually text mining applications need level representation techniques support analysis text level
 obviously levels combined combined order support sophisticated applications
 summarize major takeaway points
 Text representation determines kind mining algorithms applied
 multiple ways represent text strings words syntactic structures entity-relation graphs knowledge predicates etc
 different representations general combined real applications extent
 For example even accurate representations syntactic structures state partial structures strictly
 recognize entities great
 general want much
 different levels combined together enable richer analysis powerful analysis
 course however focuses word-based representation
 Such techniques several advantage first general robust applicable natural language
 That big advantage approaches rely fragile natural language processing techniques
 Secondly require much manual effort sometimes require manual effort
 important benefit means apply directly application
 Third techniques actually surprisingly powerful effective form implications
 Although course explained
 effective partly words invented humans basically units communications
 actually quite sufficient representing kinds semantics
 makes kind word-based representation powerful
 finally word-based representation techniques enable representation combined many sophisticated approaches
