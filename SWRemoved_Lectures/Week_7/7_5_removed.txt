 textual representation
 discuss textual representation discuss natural language processing allow represent text many different ways
 Let take look example sentence
 represent sentence many different ways
 First always represent sentence string characters
 true languages store computer
 When store natural language sentence string characters perhaps general way representing text since always use approach represent text data
 unfortunately using representation help semantic analysis often needed many applications text mining
 reason even recognizing words
 string keep spaces ASCII symbols
 perhaps count frequent character English text correlation characters ca really analyze semantics
 Yet general way representing text use represent natural language text
 try little bit natural language processing word segmentation obtain representation text form sequence words
 identify words dog chasing etc
 level representation certainly lot things mainly words basic units human communication natural language powerful
 By identifying words example easily count frequent words document whole collection etc
 words used form topics combine related words together words positive words negative sentiment analysis
 representing text data sequence words opens lot interesting analysis possibilities
 However level representation slightly less general string characters languages Chinese actually easy identify word boundaries language text sequence characters space
 rely special techniques identify words
 language course might make mistakes segmenting words
 sequence words representation robust string characters
 English easy obtain level representation time
 go naturally language processing add part speech tags
 count example frequent nouns kind nouns associated kind verbs etc
 opens little bit interesting opportunities analysis
 Note use plus sign representing text sequence part speech tags necessarily replace original word sequence written
 Instead add additional way representing text data data represented sequence words sequence part speech tags
 enriches representation text data thus enables interesting analysis
 go pausing sentence often obtain syntactic structure
 course open interesting analysis example writing styles correcting grammar mistakes
 go semantic analysis might able recognize dog animal recognize boy person playground location
 analyze relations example dog chasing boy boy playground
 add entities relations entity relation recreation
 At level even interesting things
 For example count easily frequent person mentioning whole collection news articles whenever mention person tend mentioning another person etc
 useful representation related knowledge graph may heard Google semantic way representing text data
 However less robust sequence words even syntactical analysis always easy identify entities right types might make mistakes relations even harder find might make mistakes
 makes level representation less robust yet useful
 move logical condition predicates even inference rules
 With inference rules infer interesting derived facts text useful
 unfortunately level representation even less robust make mistakes ca time kinds sentences
 Finally speech acts add yet another level repetition intent saying sentence
 case might request
 knowing allow analyze even interesting things observer author sentence
 What intention saying What scenarios What kind actions made another level analysis interesting
 picture shows move generally sophisticated natural language processing techniques used
 Unfortunately techniques require human effort less accurate
 That means mistakes
 add texts levels representing deeper analysis language tolerate errors
 means still necessary combine deep analysis shallow analysis based example sequence words
 On right side arrow points indicate
 As go representation text closer knowledge representation mind need solving lot problems
 desirable represent text level knowledge easily extract knowledge
 That purpose text-mining
 trade-off deeper analysis might errors give direct knowledge extracted text
 Doing shallow analysis robust actually give necessary deeper representation knowledge
 say text data generated humans meant consumed humans
 result text data analysis text-mining humans play important role always loop
 Meaning optimize collaboration humans computers
 sense okay computers may able compute accurately representation text data patterns extracted text data interpreted humans humans guide computers accurate analysis annotating data providing features guide machine learning programs make work effectively
