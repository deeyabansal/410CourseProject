 first one text clustering
 talk text clustering
 important technique topic mining analysis
 particular start basic questions clustering
 text clustering interested text clustering
 following lectures talk text clustering
 How evaluate clustering results text clustering Well clustering actually general technique data mining might learned courses
 idea discover natural structures data
 another words want group similar objects together
 case objects course text objects
 For example documents terms passages sentences websites go group similar text objects together
 let example well really text objects used shapes denote objects grouped together
 ask natural structures natural groups look might agree group objects based chips locations two dimensional space
 got three clusters case
 may much agreement three clusters really depends perspective look objects
 Maybe seen thing different way might get different clusters
 another example ambiguity clearly
 main point problem actually well defined
 problem lies define similarity
 mean similar objects problem clearly defined order well defined clustering problem
 problem general two objects similar depending look
 example kept two words car horse
 two words similar Well depends look physical properties car horse different look functionally car horse transportation tools
 sense may similar
 really depends perspective look objects
 ought make clustering problem well defined
 user must define perspective assessing similarity
 call perspective clustering bias
 define clustering problem important specify perspective similarity defining similarity used group similar objects
 otherwise similarity well defined one different ways group objects
 let look example
 seeing objects shapes similar seen first slide ask group objects might feel previous slide
 For example might think well steer group ships give cluster looks
 However might feel well maybe objects grouped based sizes
 give different way cluster data look size look similarity size
 clearly depending perspective get different clustering result
 clearly tells order evaluate clustering without must use perspective
 Without perspective hard define best clustering result
 many examples text clustering setup
 example cluster documents whole text collection
 case documents units clustered
 may able cluster terms
 case terms objects
 cluster terms used define concept theme topic
 fact topic models seen previous lectures give cluster terms sense take terms high probabilities word distribution
 Another example cluster text segments example passages sentences segments extract former larger text objects
 For example might extract order text segments topic let say using topic model
 got text objects cluster segments got discover interesting clusters might ripple subtopics
 case combining text clustering techniques
 general lot text mining accurate combined flexible way achieve goal sophisticated mining analysis text data
 cluster fairly large text objects mean text objects may contain lot documents
 example might cluster websites
 Each website actually compose multiple documents
 Similarly cluster articles written author example
 trigger articles published one unit clustering
 way might group authors together based whether published papers similar
 For text clusters cluster generate hierarchy
 That general cluster text object different levels
 generally text clustering interesting Well useful technique text mining particularly exploratory text analysis
 typical scenario getting lot text data let say email messages customers time period literature articles etc
 hope get sense overall content connection example might interested getting sense major topics typical representative documents connection
 clustering help achieve goal
 sometimes want link similar text objects together
 objects might duplicated content example
 case technique help remove redundancy remove duplicate documents
 Sometimes topic linking together complete coverage topic
 may used text clustering create structure text data sometimes create hierarchy structures useful problems
 may use text clustering induce additional features represent text data cluster documents together treat cluster feature
 say document cluster feature value one
 document cluster feature value zero
 helps provide additional discrimination might used text classification discuss later
 general many applications text clustering
 thought two specific ones
 One cluster search results example [ INAUDIBLE ] search engine cluster results user overall structure results return fall query
 query ambiguous particularly useful clusters likely represent different senses ambiguous word
 Another application understand major complaints customers based emails right
 case cluster email messages find major clusters understand major complaints
