 text categorization
 talk text categorization
 important technique text data mining analytics
 relevant discovery various different kinds knowledge shown
 First related topic mining analysis
 analyzing text data based predefined topics
 Secondly related opinion mining sentiment analysis discovery knowledge observer human sensor
 Because categorize authors example based content articles written right general categorize observer based content produce
 Finally related text-based prediction
 Because often use text categorization techniques predict variables real world remotely related text data
 important technique text data mining
 overall plan covering topic
 First talk text categorization interested talk text categorization evaluate categorization results
 problem text categorization defined follows
 given set predefined categories possibly forming hierarchy
 often set training examples training set labeled text objects means text objects already enabled known categories
 task classify text object one predefined categories
 picture slide shows happens
 When text categorization lot text objects processed categorization system system general assign categories documents
 As shown right categorization results often assume availability training examples documents tag known categories
 examples important helping system learn patterns different categories
 help system know recognize categories new text objects seen
 specific examples text categorization
 fact many examples
 first text objects vary categorize document passage sentence collections text
 As case clustering units analyzed vary lot creates lot possibilities
 Secondly categories vary
 Allocate general two major kinds categories
 One internal categories
 categories categorize content text object
 For example topic categories sentiment categories generally content text objects throughout categorization content
 kind external categories characterize entity associated text object
 For example authors entities associated content produce
 use content determining author written part example called author attribution
 Or mininal categories associate text data long minimal connection entity text data
 For example might collect lot reviews restaurant lot reviews product text data help infer properties product restaurant
 case treat categorization problem
 categorize restaurants categorize products based corresponding reviews
 example external category
 Here specific examples applications
 News categorization common started lot
 News agencies assign predefined categories categorize news generated everyday
 virtual article categorizations important aspect
 For example biomedical domain MeSH annotations
 MeSH stands Medical Subject Heading ontology terms characterize content literature articles detail
 Another example application spam email detection filtering right often spam filter help distinguish spams legitimate emails clearly binary classification problem
 Sentiment categorization product reviews tweets yet another kind applications categorize comparing positive negative positive negative neutral
 send categories assign two text content
 Another application automatic email routing sorting might want automatically sort emails different folders one application text categorization folder category
 results another important kind applications routing emails right person handle helpdesk email messaging generally routed particular person handle
 Different people tend handle different kinds requests
 many cases person manually assign messages right people
 imagine ca able automatically text categorization system help routing request
 class file incoming request one categories category actually corresponds person handle request
 finally author attribution mentioned yet another application another example using text actually infer properties entities
 many variants problem formulation
 first simplest case binary categorization two categories
 many examples information retrieval search engine
 Applications one distinguishing relevant documents non-relevant documents particular query
 Spam filtering distinguishing spams non-spams two categories
 Sometimes classifications opinions two categories positive negative
 general case K-category categorization many applications could two categories
 topic categorization often example multiple topics
 Email routing another example may multiple folders route email right person handle multiple people classify
 cases two kinds categories
 Another variation hierarchical categorization categories form hierarchy
 Again topical hierarchy common
 Yet another variation joint categorization
 That multiple categorization tasks related hope kind join categorization
 Further leverage dependency tasks improve accuracy individual task
 Among binary categorizations fundamental part simple probably actually used perform categorization tasks
 For example K-category categorization task actually performed using binary categorization
 Basically look category separately binary categorization problem whether object category meaning categories
 hierarchical categorization done progressively flat categorization level
 first categorize objects let say small number high-level categories inside category categorized sub-categories etc
 text categorization important Well already showed several applications general several reasons
 One text categorization helps enrich text representation achieve understanding text data useful text analysis
 categorization text represented multiple levels
 keyword conditions often used lot text processing tasks
 add categories provide two levels transition
 Semantic categories assigned directly indirectly useful application
 example semantic categories could already useful attribution might directly useful
 Another example semantic categories facilitate aggregation text content another case applications text categorization
 For example want know overall opinions product could first categorize opinions individual view positive negative allow easy aggregate sentiment tell 70 % views positive 30 % negative etc
 without categorization much harder aggregate opinions provide concise way coding text sense based vocabulary
 sometimes may applications text categorizations called text coded encoded control vocabulary
 second kind reasons use text categorization infer properties entities text categories allows infer properties entities associate text data
 means use text categorization discover knowledge world
 general long associate entity text data always text data help categorize corresponding entities
 used single information network connect entities text data
 obvious entities directly connected authors
 imagine author affiliations author age things actually connected text data indirectly
 Once made connection make prediction values
 general way allow use text mining text categorization discover knowledge world
 Very useful especially big text data analytics often using text data extra sets data extracted humans infer certain decision factors often together non-textual data
 Specifically text example think examples inferring properties entities
 For example discovery non-native speakers language
 done categorizing content speakers
 Another example predict party affiliation politician based political speech
 example using text data infer knowledge real world
 nature problems defined text categorization problem
