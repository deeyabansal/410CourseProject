 Opinion Mining Sentiment Analysis covering Motivation
 start talking mining different kind knowledge
 Namely knowledge observer humans generated text data
 particular talk opinion mining sentiment analysis
 As discussed earlier text data regarded data generated humans subjective sensors
 contrast devices video recorder report happening real world objective generate viewer data example
 main difference test data data video data rich opinions content tends subjective generated humans
 actually unique advantaged text data compared data office great opportunity understand observers
 mine text data understand opinions
 Understand people preferences people think something
 following lectures mainly mine analyze opinions buried lot text data
 let start concept opinion
 easy formally define opinion mostly define opinion subjective statement describing person believes thinks something
 highlighted quite words
 worth thinking little bit words
 help better understand opinion
 helps define opinion formally
 Which always needed computation resolve problem opinion mining
 let first look key word subjective
 contrast objective statement factual statement
 Those statements proved right wrong
 key differentiating factor opinions tends easy prove wrong right reflects person thinks something
 contrast objective statement usually proved wrong correct
 For example might say computer screen battery
 something check
 either battery
 contrast think sentence laptop best battery laptop nice screen
 statements subjective hard prove whether wrong correct
 opinion subjective statement
 next lets look keyword person
 indicates opinion holder
 Because talk opinion opinion held someone
 notice something
 target opinion
 opinion expressed something
 course believes thinks implies opinion depend culture background context general
 Because person might think different different context
 People different background may think different ways
 analysis shows multiple elements need include order characterize opinion
 basic opinion representation Well include least three elements right Firstly specify opinion holder
 whose opinion Second must specify target opinion third course want opinion content
 exactly opinion identify get basic understanding opinion already useful sometimes
 want understand want enriched opinion representation
 means want understand example context opinion situation opinion expressed
 For example time expressed people understand opinion sentiment understand opinion tells opinion holder feeling
 For example opinion positive negative Or perhaps opinion holder happy sad understanding obvious beyond Extracting opinion content needs analysis
 let take simple example product review
 case actually expressed opinion holder expressed target
 obviously whats opinion holder reviewer often clear whats opinion target product review example iPhone 6
 When review posted usually ca information easier
 content course review text general easy obtain
 product reviews fairly easy analyze terms obtaining basic opinion representation
 course want get information might know Context example
 review written 2015
 Or want know sentiment review positive
 additional understanding course adds value mining opinions
 case task relatively easy opinion holder opinion target already identified
 let take look sentence news
 case implicit holder implicit target
 tasker general harder
 identify opinion holder governor Connecticut
 identify target
 one target Hurricane Sandy another target mentioned hurricane 1938
 opinion Well negative sentiment indicated words bad worst
 identify context New England case
 unlike playoff review elements must extracted using natural RAM processing techniques
 task Is much harder
 need deeper natural language processing
 examples suggest lot work easy done product reviews
 That indeed happened
 Analyzing assembling news still quite difficult difficult analysis opinions product reviews
 interesting variations
 fact examine variations opinions systematically
 First let think opinion holder
 holder could individual could group people
 Sometimes opinion committee
 Or whole country people
 Opinion target accounts vary lot
 one entity particular person particular product particular policy ect
 could group products
 Could products company general
 Could specific one attribute though
 An attribute entity
 For example battery iPhone
 could someone else opinion
 one person might comment another person Opinion etc
 lot variation cause problem vary lot
 opinion content course vary lot surface identify one-sentence opinion one-phrase opinion
 longer text express opinion whole article
 furthermore identify variation sentiment emotion damage feeding opinion holder
 distinguish positive versus negative mutual happy versus sad separate
 Finally opinion context vary
 simple context different time different locations
 could complex contexts background topic discussed
 opinion expressed particular discourse context interpreted different ways expressed another context
 context [ INAUDIBLE ] entire discourse context opinion
 From computational perspective mostly interested opinions extracted text data
 turns differentiate distinguish different kinds opinions text data computation perspective
 First observer might make comment opinion targeting observe word case author opinion
 For example phone
 opinion author
 contrast text might report opinions others
 person could Make observation another person opinion reported opinion
 example believe loves painting
 opinion really really expressed another person
 mean author loves painting
 clearly two kinds opinions need analyzed different ways sometimes product reviews although mostly opinions false reviewer
 Sometimes reviewer might mention opinions friend friend
 Another complication may indirect opinions inferred opinions obtained
 By making inferences expressed text might necessarily look opinion
 For example one statement might phone ran battery one hour
 way factual statement either true false right even verify statement one infer negative opinions quality battery phone feeling opinion holder battery
 opinion holder clearly wished battery last longer
 interesting variations need pay attention extract opinions
 reason indirect opinions often useful extract whatever person said product sometimes factual sentences useful
 practical viewpoint sometimes necessarily extract subject sentences
 Instead sentences opinions useful understanding person understanding product commend
 task opinion mining defined taking textualized input generate set opinion representations
 Each representation identify opinion holder target content context
 Ideally infer opinion sentiment comment context better understand
 opinion
 often elements representation already known
 gave good example case product use opinion holder opinion target often expressly identified
 turns one simplest opinion mining tasks
 interesting think tasks might simple
 Because cases easily build applications using opinion mining techniques
 talked opinion mining defined task
 Let talk little bit opinion mining important useful
 identify three major reasons three broad reasons
 first help decision support
 help optimize decisions
 often look people opinions look read reviews order make decisions buying product using service
 interested others opinions decide vote example
 policy makers may want know people opinions designing new policy
 one general kind applications
 broad course
 second application understand people important
 For example could help understand people preferences
 could help better serve people
 For example optimize product search engine optimize recommender system know people interested people think product
 help advertising course targeted advertising know kind people tend kind plot
 third kind application called voluntary survey
 important research used done surveys manual surveys
 Question answer
 People need feel informs answer questions
 directly related humans sensors usually aggregate opinions lot humans kind assess general opinion
 useful business intelligence manufacturers want know products advantages others
 What winning features products winning features competitive products
 Market research understanding consumers oppinions
 create useful directive
 Data-driven social science research benefit text mining understand people opinions
 aggregate lot opinions social media lot popular information actually study questions
 For example study behavior people social media social networks
 regarded voluntary survey done people
 general gain lot advantage prediction task leverage text data extra data problem
 use text based prediction techniques help make predictions improve accuracy prediction
